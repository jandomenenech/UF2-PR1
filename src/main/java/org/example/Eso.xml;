      <review>["The first playthrough of elden ring is one of the best eperiences gaming can offer you but after youve explored everything in the open world and you've experienced all of the surprises you lose motivation to go exploring on repeat playthroughs which takes a lot away from the replayability which is a very important thing for from games imo."</review>
      <review>'a replay solidified my love for elden ring. so easily my favorite game of all time. actually beating malenia this time was also an amazing feeling. i just love being in this world man its the greatest of all time'</review>

    <summary>A rogue-lite hack and slash dungeon crawler in which Zagreus, son of Hades the Greek god of the dead, attempts to escape his home and his oppressive father by fighting the souls of the dead through the various layers of the ever-shifting underworld, while getting to know and forging relationships with its inhabitants.</summary>

      <review>['convinced this is a roguelike for people who do not like the genre. The art is technically good but the aesthetic does very little for me</review>
      <review>too clean or something. idk wish I liked it but I do not'</review>
      <review>'incredible art</review>
      <review>a banger soundtrack a surprisingly charming storyline and a big red dog. hades has very smooth gameplay but after playing it for a while it just feels like youre doing the same 3 hit combo ove and over again</review>
      <review>which dont get me wrong that combo feels great to do but once i becomes muscle memory you kinda go into autopilot. also i think the boons are cool but i would like to see them change the flow of combat a bit more</review>
      <review>there are some cool ones like the grape boon that can change the way you play but most of them are just upgrades that dont really change the gameplay or strategy. other then those 2 small gripes the game is fantastic.'</review>
      <review>"People tell me this game gets really really good at some point but i've beaten entire games in the amount of time I gave this game."</review>
      <review>'Não sou muito de jogo indie</review>
      <review>admito que joguei poucos</review>

      <review>"I can't shake the feeling that I am thoroughly bored playing Hades. I've picked up Hades three times over the last few years</review>
      <review>and three times I've found myself putting down the controller after a handful of hours</review>
      <review>especially after reaching the third stage</review>
      <review>and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working for me. After giving it a few good goes</review>
      <review>I've finally managed to pin down what it is that just doesn't click for me about Hades."</review>
      <review>'One of my favorites in the rogue-likes/lites</review>
      <review>only being beat by binding of Isaac. I love the characters (Thanatos my beloved) and the writing and the art style and RRRAAAAHHH THIS GAME IS AWESOME']</review>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the first 3D open-world game in the Zelda series. Link can travel anywhere and be equipped with weapons and armor found throughout the world to grant him various bonuses. Unlike many games in the series, Breath of the Wild does not impose a specific order in which quests or dungeons must be completed. While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method. A lot of critics ranked Breath of the Wild as one of the best video games of all time.</summary>

      <review>['This game is the game (that is not CS:GO) that I have played the most ever. I have played this game for 400 hours.'</review>
      <review>"A really good switch game</review>
      <review>however didn't really grip me like mario odyssey"</review>
      <review>"i was very disappointed by the final boss fight</review>
      <review>but the rest of the game is so good it makes me not want to even do the final boss fight anyway just so i can play more of the game. i do wish that there were more unique mechanics in combat besides just parrying and link's flurry rush</review>
      <review>but the world is really pretty and actually incentivizes exploring it. characters are great</review>
      <review>story is great and makes you work for it</review>
      <review>and there's tons of hidden secrets and details."</review>
      <review>'em 105 horas de jogo não houve um segundo que eu não tava me divertindo e eu acho que isso diz muito'</review>
      <review>'Sencillamente el mejor juego que he tenido el placer de disfrutar</review>
      <review>esperé 5 años para poder jugarlo y puedo decir que valió cada segundo la espera. No estoy ni cerca de conseguir el 100%</review>
      <review>tengo mas de 100 horas y aún estoy descubriendo cosas nuevas. Va más allá de un simple juego</review>
      <review>es una experiencia que lamentablemente solo se puede vivir una vez en la vida y la recomiendo totalmente.'</review>
      <review>'em meio a tanto jogo de mundo aberto ruim saindo por aí na última década</review>
      <review>acho que da pra entender porque breath of the wild chocou tanto as pessoas no ano em que ele lançou. E realmente eu acho que é o melhor mundo aberto que eu já joguei até hoje</review>
      <review>explorar cada pedacinho desse mundo é TÃO GOSTOSO</review>
      <review>parece que tudo aqui tá no mapa tem um propósito para estar lá</review>
      <review>diferente dos mapas vazios da ubisoft por exemplo. Acho que o unico defeito é esses sistema chatinho de durabilidade das armas</review>
      <review>ficar trocando de arma o tempo todo é tão chato</review>

      <review>with its amazing soundtrack and gorgeous art direction it really makes you feel like you're spiderman. one of the best value in gaming tbh</review>
      <review>this game is packed full of content and none of it feels like filler. even the boss rush manages to feel fresh by introducing some surprise bosses/boss variants as rewards for beating tough pantheons. cant wait to play silksong when i turn 80!"</review>

      <review>now I'm seeking for similar adventures and I can't wait for Silksong.\n \n I've done all 112% in my first run and now I'm beating the game again</review>

      <review>'Faz uns 2/3 anos que eu zerei esse jogo</review>

      <review>'A rivetting action/adventure game with a stunning design. Extremely rewarding but also gruesomly difficult at times.'</review>
      <review>'I\'d give this game a 4 for each individual aspect (platforming</review>
      <review>exploration</review>
      <review>combat) but the integration and packaging of the content are so good</review>
      <review>it\'s slightly better that the sum of its parts. Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful</review>

      <review>reminiscent of Wiley\'s fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized</review>
      <review>were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as "not my style" to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n \n -The repeated backtracking. I get it - a fast-travel mechanic that\'s too liberal can erase the environment</review>
      <review>but this was excessive.\n \n -Some of the charms seemed worthless</review>
      <review>even after strategizing for boss</review>
      <review>combat</review>
      <review>and platforming rushes.\n \n -In the name of decency and civility</review>

    <summary>Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with, and modify a dynamically-generated map made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.</summary>

      <review>but have differing views through the story. The combat is more fleshed out than its predecessor due to chips and pod mechanics. Characters change and face reality after meeting characters and concepts never seen before.'</review>
      <review>'This is my favorite game ever and the only game I cared enough about to get the platinum trophy in. I might be biased here but the game has a lot of things I loved going in like the post apocalyptic setting. The game isn’t perfect and while things like the 9s hacking and route b pushed a lot of people away I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Getting ending s and the final shut em up section in the credits ending with me giving up my save file to protect a fellow player is one of the most beautiful moments I’ve seen in fiction as a whole']</review>

      <review>but I personally have my nitpicks with it</review>
      <review>such as:\n \n -The pacing of the game\n \n -The fact it only gets good 30-40 hours into the game\n \n -The fact that essential</review>
      <review>strategic</review>
      <review>and most importantly</review>
      <review>fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid-battle\n \n -The lack of freedom to do what you want\n \n -Similar to SMT IV/IV:A (and maybe other SMT/Persona games</review>
      <review>idk) they sell DLC for super powerful personas. In SMTIV at least</review>
      <review>these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal</review>
      <review>they included the DLC</review>
      <review>which again</review>
      <review>I could ignore if they are optional</review>
      <review>but I can't. Unlike in pervious games</review>
      <review>there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally</review>
      <review>which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\n \n -And more importantly</review>

      <review>I guess finished half or two-thirds of it? Cannot say I didn't like Persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last. I played some SMT games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful (especially the 4th). However</review>
      <review>I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game</review>
      <review>although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something</review>
      <review>like 5-10 hours more</review>
      <review>and something incredible would happen for sure</review>
      <review>characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin... Never happened. Might finish it sometime later tho</review>

      <review>lore ramifications for sinnoh</review>

      <review>the levels especially alabaster Icelands and cobalt coastlands feel janky and overly linear despite the game encouraging more mobile movement and freedom</review>
      <review>and of course the lack of meaningful presentation through stiff character animations and lack of voice acting hurt this game alot. I still feel like Pokémon gameplay has peaked here but they just don’t let these games cook long enough and only get away with it because Pokémon fans only play Pokémon and don’t branch out to know what’s actually good'</review>

Lembro de na época ninguém gostar tanto do jogo principalmente por fugir muito do resto da franquia mas mano é um spin off tá ligado? Sei que é meio chato ver sua franquia mudando mas a maestria que esse jogo faz junto com a continuação da história do Raiden (que já era um personagem não muito gostado e mais um motivo pra não gostarem do jogo) faz ele ser um dos jogos mais importantes pra mim.

      <review>so i will mostly probobly be comparing it to xenoblade 1. The concept is immedietly quite interesting</review>
      <review>although'</review>
      <review>"hmmmmmmm. Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters</review>
      <review>the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didn't add to much</review>
      <review>if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect</review>
      <review>this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke</review>
      <review>with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though</review>
      <review>it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game</review>
      <review>which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games</review>
      <review>and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series</review>
      <review>but this definitely didn't hit as much as the first or even the second game to me. Still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh..."]</review>

    <summary>Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles. Inspired by cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional cel animation (hand drawn &amp; hand inked!), watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings. Play as Cuphead or Mugman (in single player or co-op) as you traverse strange worlds, acquire new weapons, learn powerful super moves, and discover hidden secrets. Cuphead is all action, all the time.</summary>

      <review>'A brilliant</review>
      <review>hard but clever and never unfair run-and-gun shooter. The platformer levels were unnecessary and are not as good as the others</review>

      <review>"I've had a bit of a troubled history with Cuphead. Before now I've tried it on two different occasions</review>
      <review>both with varying results. My first attempt ended pretty swiftly since I didn't have a controller and the keyboard controls are... really bad! The game didn't quite jive with me at that point</review>

      <review>in co-op with a friend. We did this over Steam so there was a bit of lag</review>
      <review>but I had a controller and a friend to help me through. I enjoyed the game a lot more</review>
      <review>to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together</review>
      <review>but it still didn't quite enamour me like I'd wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen</review>
      <review>often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information</review>
      <review>so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything</review>

      <review>["Im waiting for this game to grab me but it hasn't happened yet.\n \n I dont know why I enjoy dying to the same boss for 3 hours in Soulsborne games but not in this game."</review>
      <review>'Loved this a lot. I missed the sense of exploration from Dark Souls</review>
      <review>but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it. Other than a basic whole number for your damage and health</review>
      <review>there\'s no worrying about RPG values here. It\'s a true action game taking place within the open-world Metroid-ish Souls structure</review>
      <review>backed up with\n \n some\n \n items and buffs and junk if you decide to use them. But the lack of gear is probably the best thing about this - no armour sets</review>
      <review>no elemental stats</review>
      <review>no sword that deals +5 damage but -2 stamina. Funnily enough</review>
      <review>people say this is the hardest FromSoftware game</review>
      <review>but after a while it felt much</review>
      <review>much easier to me than Dark Souls\n \n because\n \n there was nothing in my way except my own skill</review>
      <review>which I greatly prefer. No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I don\'t like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better</review>
      <review>because then it\'s this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled</review>
      <review>or I said "screw it"</review>
      <review>summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly</review>
      <review>once you get that perfect parry timing down</review>
      <review>sometimes victory comes so fast that it\n \n almost\n \n feels unsatisfying. Happened to me with the final boss</review>
      <review>funnily enough.'</review>
      <review>'It only took me three playthroughs but I finally like this game! Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout</review>
      <review>though</review>
      <review>which isn\'t new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a "correct" way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble</review>
      <review>but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you that\'s bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing that\'s bad and sucks</review>
      <review>and that\'s bad and sucks.'</review>
      <review>"Toujours en balance avec Bloodborne et Dark Souls pour le titre de meilleur jeu de chez FromSoftware. Une caméra un peu capricieuse par moments mais sinon c'est intestable."</review>

    <summary>Final Fantasy VII is the seventh main installment in the Final Fantasy series, and was the first title to feature three-dimensional graphics, pre-rendered backgrounds and numerous full motion videos. The gameplay is a departure from previous entries in the series in many ways. Though it retains the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system, FFVII features three party members rather than four. The Materia system allows the player to customize each party member's abilities to their liking, and the Limit system grants them unique combat skills. Though minigames had been a recurring feature, FFVII introduces numerous new ones, many of them playable in the theme park Gold Saucer varying from racing with Chocobos to snowboarding.</summary>

    <summary>Resident Evil 2 is a remake of 1998's Resident Evil 2. The game was not developed with the intent of improving the original, but rather a reimagining of the original story with redesigned maps, characters and story elements. Gameplay mechanics are more similar to Resident Evil 7: Biohazard though with the use of an over-the-shoulder camera.</summary>

      <review>["I remember not thinking too much about the original RE2. Don't get me wrong</review>
      <review>it's a great game</review>
      <review>but with REmake</review>
      <review>RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch</review>
      <review>but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever</review>
      <review>with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this</review>
      <review>being incredibly realistic yet stylized</review>
      <review>even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasn't worth it because the story barely changed</review>
      <review>but that's completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories</review>
      <review>but they also have different accessible rooms</review>
      <review>gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one</review>
      <review>and although that's also the case here</review>
      <review>both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way. This is easily my favorite RE game (at least until 4 Remake comes out) and one of my top 5 games of all time</review>
      <review>so you better believe that I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone."</review>
      <review>'My entry point of the series (don’t ask) this remake of my first entry of the series and causing it to grow my love for the series in general this game is really really good and I had a fun time overall when playing this game and since I’m rating this out of pure nostalgia of Raccoon City and overall experience I think this game really deserves 5 stars but when playing this game I got really bad luck with its rng of Mr X and some Lickers since they actually keep killing me and at one point made a somewhat of a stun lock move so I have to take out half a star but it’s still worth playing since it is a very beautiful upgrade to the game I played as a kid and it’s as good as I remember'</review>
      <review>'A really well done vision of what survival horror games could be and a great remake of this beloved classic in general.'</review>
      <review>'I dont have much to say but I really like this game. Its what you expect from Resident Evil.'</review>
      <review>'peak survival horror'</review>
      <review>'Lembro de ter jogado no ano de lançamento e ter ficado encantado com toda a imersão do jogo de um ar obscuro que já havia visto em resident evil 7. Após anos</review>
      <review>decidi jogar o original e percebi tantas novas camadas daquela época que comecei a ser mais critico em comparação a esse jogo. Agora</review>

    <summary>The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game set five years after the events of The Last of Us. The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. He can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The game intermittently switches control between Ellie and Abby, and also briefly Joel in the opening sequence. The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat.</summary>

      <review>não compre esperando um jogo com história complexa e tocante</review>
      <review>é uma história bobinha só para não deixar os personagem estarem ali só por estar.\n \n A melhor parte do jogo é definitivamente a gameplay e o level desing</review>
      <review>esses dois fatores combinam tão bem juntos que depois de se acostumar ao jogo</review>
      <review>mesmo sendo a primeira vez na fase tu já vê um possível atalho ou ate mesmo um segredo.\n \n Acho esse jogo muito pouco reconhecido</review>
      <review>tanto que eu só fui descobrir que ele lançou 4 meses depois do seu lançamento.'</review>
      <review>'A high-speed mix of a puzzle platformer and FPS</review>
      <review>\n \n Neon White\n \n is a stylish speedrunner\'s dream. You play as the eponymous "Neon White" as you fight demons to improve your credit score enough to not be vaporized by the forces of Heaven for another year</review>
      <review>in a vague\n \n The World Ends With You\n \n type competition. To assist in your demon hunting</review>
      <review>there are a number of different weapon cards that provide some ammunition</review>
      <review>or a secondary movement ability. While defeating all the demons in a level is the stated goal</review>
      <review>in reality the game is about navigating yourself between platforms</review>
      <review>using the ability of the cards to assist you. The environments are great looking</review>

      <review>memorizing the way forward to get the best times. If this game was just a level select screen</review>
      <review>I think it might be my favorite game of the year thus far</review>

      <review>and that is the plot. It\'s an incredibly stereotypical anime amnesia plot full of boring psychopathic enemies</review>
      <review>cringy sexual innuendos</review>
      <review>and awful voice acting. Yes</review>
      <review>I know the guy who played Spike is in it</review>
      <review>but this is not his best performance. I ended up muting the voice audio</review>
      <review>and that helped quite a bit</review>
      <review>but the plot still has nothing to offer. If you skip all the cutscenes though</review>
      <review>I think this game is definitely a must play.'</review>

    <summary>Resident Evil 4 is the sixth installment of the Resident Evil series praised as a revolution from the core games. It was the first title to implement a third-person view rather than the original fixed camera angles its predecessors had. Its mechanics have been completely revamped to incorporate fast-paced gunplay, quick controls and shoot-outs involving massive crowds of enemies in more open areas. The brand-new AI system and open environments allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. Resident Evil 4 had one of the most tormented developments in any game, four proposed versions of the game were discarded by the developers before the finished product was released.</summary>

      <review>'Better than Forces and Lost World but that’s not saying much. Overworld was cool to explore but it was trying too hard to be Breath of the Wild.

      <review>'Excited for the sequel assuming they don’t completely change the formula again because this is a really solid foundation that feels fresh if a little bare bones at times. Super fun to run around and the music is really nice. Glad to have a story where the characters take the events seriously without joking every 5 seconds. The story itself is ok</review>
      <review>but the final act is clearly unfinished and rushed has probably one of the worst final bosses in the whole series which really undermines the ending a bit.

    <summary>Tunic is an action adventure about a tiny fox in a big world. Explore the wilderness, discover spooky ruins, and fight terrible creatures from long ago.</summary>

      <review>['PEAK. A near flawless game for me and really encapsulates what I love about the medium. Exceptional effort and turned out just as well as I’d hoped. I’ve beaten it 5 times now (granted new game plus with all your upgrades and knowing where to go makes it much easier). I did find it to be very difficult at points and it can be somewhat easy to get lost. Also a vital system for progression can be too cryptic</review>
      <review>but rewarding once you crack it. That’s about my only gripes. Must play game. Gorgeous artstyle</review>
      <review>no handholdy nonsense</review>
      <review>fun gameplay</review>
      <review>top tier OST</review>
      <review>great story</review>
      <review>and an overall perfect action-adventure game. It’s littered with secrets as well so your exploration is rewarded (pay attention to the manual!). Andrew Shouldice goated fr 5/5 ⭑'</review>
      <review>"Tunic is a wonderful 2D Zelda-like that feels like a love letter to the genre. Between an extremely charming aesthetic</review>
      <review>fun and interesting items</review>
      <review>and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery</review>
      <review>it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre. The inclusions of things like a made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were a kid trying to play a game like Link's Awakening. Discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player. I feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game</review>
      <review>so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing. Level design is top notch in this game and I love all the secrets and hidden paths they provide using the game's isometric view. I think the weakest parts of this game compared to its contemporaries is the mood of the game."</review>
      <review>'Tunic es un buen juego que no he podido disfrutar al máximo. Aunque la jugabilidad es buena y está bastante pulida</review>
      <review>la historia</review>
      <review>o lo que yo he entendido</review>
      <review>me ha gustado mucho y la BSO cumple bastante</review>
      <review>la mecánica de que todo gire en torno al manual y el no poder entender la gran mayoría de la información que tienes o encuentras me ha fastidiado mucho la experiencia. Dicho esto</review>
      <review>no es juego que yo recomendaría'</review>
      <review>'Like 5 minutes after finding the rey key I found the map to that dungeon and honestly I find that pretty funny'</review>
      <review>'Esse é o único jogo que eu me motivei a platinar. É rápido</review>
      <review>tranquilo e divertido. E os mistérios desse jogo... Meu Deus</review>
      <review>eu nunca vi nenhum jogo apresentar suas mecânicas dessa forma</review>
      <review>coisas que você poderia fazer desde o início mas só foi aprender na metade</review>
      <review>por isso que voltar nos lugares é tão incrível</review>
      <review>porque você volta diferente</review>
      <review>com conhecimento. Tunic pra mim foi uma experiência única</review>
      <review>onde eu pensava sim que ia gostar mas não imaginava nem de longe as coisas que ia me fazer sentir. Minha opinião sobre esse game é algo pessoal demais</review>
      <review>é com certeza meu indie preferido.'</review>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the fifth main installment of The Legend of Zelda series and the first to be released for the Nintendo 64. It was one of the most highly anticipated games of its age, and is listed among the greatest video games ever created by numerous websites and magazines. The gameplay of Ocarina of Time was revolutionary for its time, it has arguably made more of an impact on later games in the series than any of its predecessors even though they had the same cores of exploration, dungeons, puzzles and item usage. Among the gameplay mechanics, one of the most noteworthy is the time-traveling system. The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well and each of them has certain unique abilities. Ocarina of Time also introduces the use of music to solve puzzles: as new songs are learned, they can be used to solve puzzles, gain access to new areas and warp to different locations. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games but they are not too complex.</summary>

    <summary>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is the sequel to the espionage action game Metal Gear Solid. Much of the gameplay remains the same, as the game's protagonist has to sneak past guards, outsmart them using various gadgets and defeat the tricky boss enemies. The game expanded its predecessor's cover mechanic, with Solid Snake or Raiden able to take cover behind walls or objects and pop out to shoot at enemies, while the improved enemy AI allowed enemies to also take cover from the player. Metal Gear Solid 2 is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time, as well as a leading example of artistic expression in video games.</summary>

      <review>['i think the rolling health meter is a unique fighting mechanic</review>
      <review>this game has inspired some of my favorite modern RPGs and the sound design/art is really creative.'</review>
      <review>'Earthbound\n \n is very extraordinary in many ways and ordinary in others. As far as RPGs go</review>
      <review>the dungeon design and combat is very by-the-numbers. As far as everything else goes</review>
      <review>this game is something special.\n \n Modern settings may be quasi-common for RPGs now but I still think Earthbound does it among the best. The cartoony overtones and Peanuts-like quality to the world helps keep a fantastical air about the game in spite of you trawling through what is basically suburban America.\n \n The plot is very standard but focuses moreso on the goofy and memorable moments stringing them together. The PK Starstorm scenes in particular were cool to me</review>
      <review>Summers was a nice location to explore especially</review>
      <review>and the music has a sweet wacky vibe. Inventory management is still frustrating and the combat is plain but exploring the world is enjoyable.\n \n Great game and worth your time</review>
      <review>but more for the moment-to-moment bits of dialogue/goofiness'</review>
      <review>'A classic</review>
      <review>no better way to put it. Say "fuzzy pickles"!'</review>

Compared to the previous Zelda games, this installment is more oriented towards interaction with NPCs and has a larger variety of items, optional quests, and mini-games. It also includes a time system that spans three days, and this cycle must be reset periodically to progress through the game.</summary>

    <summary>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the final game in the Metal Gear series. It is the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes released the year before and a prequel to the original Metal Gear. The game has a complex story with long cut-scene sequences, but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier Metal Gear Solid titles. Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in Ground Zeroes are carried over: it is still an action game and stealth oriented but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map.</summary>

      <review>['kojima i love you please have my children'</review>
      <review>'Story will leave you with actual phantom pain but the gameplay is unmatched in the action stealth genre.'</review>
      <review>'Preparing for missions and utilizing all the unique gear are the best parts of MGSV. The game does nothing to justify its open world structure though and adds unnecessary grinding for materials to upgrade your base which bogs down the gameplay.'</review>
      <review>"It's hard to review this game. It has the best gameplay in the series</review>
      <review>easily</review>
      <review>but that's constantly interrupted by helicopter rides</review>

      <review>selecting your loadouts (even though</review>
      <review>for me</review>
      <review>it was the same loadout for almost every mission) and micromanaging your many recruits. Still</review>
      <review>while you're actually in the field</review>
      <review>the stealth gameplay feels excellent. But then it has the absolute worst story in the series. On the plus side... kinda... the vast majority of the story is on cassette tapes that are completely optional."</review>
      <review>'Only 10-15 hours into this game and already it\'s one of my favorites of all time. Let me illustrate why via some comparisons.\n \n Average Call of Duty mission: Walk in a straight line. Kill some people.\n \n Average F.E.A.R. mission: Walk in a straight line until you reach an arena where you will move around strategically and kill some people.\n \n Average Far Cry 3/4 mission: Drive across the world until you reach the location. Hide on a hill and snipe every bad guy at the base</review>
      <review>then walk inside. Or sneak inside</review>
      <review>I don\'t care. This funnels you into a segment where you walk forward and kill people.\n \n Average MSGV mission: You have 15 minutes to destroy enemy vehicles. Their path is marked on your Pip Boy. Call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead</review>
      <review>then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank</review>
      <review>pick up the grenade launcher</review>

      <review>and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. Next</review>
      <review>you get a message that a Jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. It\'s across the river. User your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard</review>

      <review>park the Jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way. Find a place to hide so you can ambush the vehicle. This is just the first half of the mission. And if you die</review>
      <review>you can approach it a completely different way.\n \n This game feels like it takes Far Cry 4 and turns every gameplay element except for the open world up to 11. Instead of just shutting down the radios at a base</review>
      <review>you can destroy their comms equipment</review>
      <review>their anti-air radar</review>
      <review>and their electrical power. Don\'t just shut off the lights--shut off the lights</review>
      <review>plant C4 on the power source</review>
      <review>and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on. But be careful</review>
      <review>because the enemies will react to anything you do. Keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing night-vision goggles.\n \n The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. Even though the game is relatively difficult (for me</review>
      <review>anyway)</review>
      <review>it always feels fair. It\'s always clear what killed me</review>
      <review>and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. Enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive I\'ve seen in a stealth game. Sure</review>
      <review>you can cheese the AI</review>
      <review>but you really have to work for it</review>
      <review>instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence. It really does feel like living through an awesome action movie rather than playing a video game.\n \n I only have a few complaints. One is that the open world really is empty; there\'s nothing besides enemy bases. I wouldn\'t so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semi-sandbox game or something equally clunky. The goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living</review>
      <review>breathing world (like Skyrim or Far Cry 4)</review>
      <review>but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. It succeeds in that regard</review>
      <review>but I do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. My other complaint is with the base management portion of the game--it feels like a mobile game</review>
      <review>and takes away from the action. I want to be sneaking around and shooting stuff</review>
      <review>not clicking through a menu.\n \n These are small complaints</review>
      <review>however</review>
      <review>and I can safely say that this game is one of the best games I have ever played. Since the game regularly goes on sale for a steep discount</review>
      <review>I heartily recommend buying it.\n \n One more thing: you can put your own music into the game to play through your Pokedex or on the helicopter. There\'s nothing quite as iconic as blasting through a base while "Back in Black" blares through the stereo</review>
      <review>or having your chopper play "Born in the USA" every time it picks you up.'</review>

    <summary>Originally intended to be the fourth installment in the Resident Evil series, Devil May Cry is an action-adventure game that introduced a host of new elements to the gaming community. Chief among them is the Stylish Rank, which grades the player's performance in combat. The game is split into Missions, which are individually scored according to various factors, such as Orbs gathered and damage taken. Additionally, Devil May Cry did away with the pre-rendered backgrounds of prior Resident Evil games in order to allow for a dynamic camera system.</summary>

    <summary>A top-down slasher/shooter with unlockable gameplay-altering masks and weapons, featuring a neon-flavoured electronic aesthetic, in which a hitman receives anonymous calls ordering him to travel to certain residences and crime dens and massacre those within, as he stumbles through unreal visions and inconsistencies without any answers to how, why or who.</summary>

      <review>"Psychonauts 2 isn't just a follow-up to an old video game</review>
      <review>it feels like the Psychonauts game Double Fine always wanted to make</review>
      <review>but they had to make the first game in order to be able to tell this story."</review>
      <review>"(Played before 2023)\n \n The best platformer out there. I love that powers are intermingled a lot of the times into exploration and combat</review>
      <review>which is FANTASTIC</review>
      <review>especially in comparison to the other platformers out there. The story and world is great with fantastic characters</review>
      <review>voice-acting and an art style that is wonderful. The concepts they create in these worlds is insane and I don't think Double Fine is praised enough for their abilities to do it</review>
      <review>and I think everyone should play this game. It is the only platformer I've ever truly one-hundred percented and completed all the achievements</review>
      <review>something I've NEVER truly done before</review>
      <review>especially without a guide."</review>
      <review>"The 'game' of Psychonauts 2 is fine. It drags in the middle and the environments get... boring somehow (maybe do to the linear nature of most minds?). The gameplay itself is solid; there're more dimensions to combat than the game initially lets on</review>
      <review>so figuring out how to go about fights is rewarding even though they're simpler. Platforming is responsive and the environments at least offer interesting ways to use platforming ability from time to time. I think this balances out to an overall 'fine' experience. It's a 1 foot deep pool of a game</review>
      <review>but the water is at least nice."</review>

      <review>I had barely touched Metroid before I decided to play Super Metroid leading up to Dread’s release.'</review>
      <review>"Never played a Prime game before</review>
      <review>was actually waiting for such a release since the switch release.\n \n It is definetely good! The whole first 2 hours of the game is peak pacing and progression</review>
      <review>after that it sadly devolves to\n \n standard metroidvania loop of backtracking and collecting further upgrades. I know it's unfair to compare it to Dread</review>
      <review>but that game had way better pacing. The music is banging</review>
      <review>the visuals are super impressive for switch hardware</review>
      <review>which is already showing it's age with games like Bayonetta 3 for example.\n \n I like it</review>
      <review>despite my gripes with some of the backtracking</review>
      <review>and the absolute trash boss that is Meta Ridley. (Especially after beating THE best bosses in gaming - Sekiro). Also the inability to skip cutscenes in a 2023 release it quite iffy.\n \n Collecting lore also heavily reminded me of Outer Wilds</review>
      <review>which I guess is the game that was influenced by Prime.\n \n Other than that a very intriguing take on a metroid FPS game</review>
      <review>I'll definetely try 2 and 3 whenever they are coming to switch and 4</review>

      <review>so this wasn't a mind-blowing experience. It is impressive how much they got right the first time though. This game doesn't feel like it's lacking much of anything besides a fast travel. I'm also shocked about how cool Samus's suit kept getting. I haven't seen any cosplay or drawings of that Phazon suit.

    <summary>After the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), a section of the city of Gotham has been turned into a prison, designed to keep the scum of the city away from the people. Bruce Wayne protests this prison but is shortly kidnapped by the despicable Hugo Strange, thus having to face the city's most powerful villains as the Batman while trying to uncover Strange's plans.</summary>

      <review>so I essentially played this game for 2 years constantly. The free roaming is great</review>
      <review>the story is engaging and experimental. Even though there are issues with bugs</review>

      <review>ele irá revelar esse segredo</review>
      <review>e é aqui que nós começamos o jogo.\n \n A história de City é perfeita do começo ao fim</review>
      <review>os personagens são excelentes e muito carismáticos.\n \n O gameplay comparado ao seu antecessor é uma grande evolução</review>
      <review>nem parecem o mesmo jogo</review>
      <review>Asylum é muito lento comparado a City</review>
      <review>o Batman neste jogo esta mais ágio e com bem mais brinquedos para se usar em combate</review>
      <review>além de estar mais complexo que o anterior. o stealth é outra mecânica positiva</review>
      <review>mais opções de assustar o capangas e bem mais frenético que o jogo anterior.\n \n Os bosses estão melhores comparados com o jogo anterior</review>

      <review>unique and lovable cast of characters (though miles edgeworth is obviously the one who shines the most)</review>
      <review>which is not something we usually encounter in a visual novel. the cases gradually got better and better and the last case was a literal masterpiece. the fourth case was my favorite though since the character development in this is just so heartwarming. the dialogue in this game never ever bored me</review>
      <review>i did not skip ONE dialogue in this game and this is the first time this happened to me in a visual novel. everything is just so well written</review>
      <review>the story is always exciting and makes you curious about what will happen in the next testimony and you also always wonder how the things will turn out while investigating. the soundtrack and the character sprites are also very well done and both of these play a big role in this game's charm.\n \n to summarize all of the written above</review>

      <review>but the charming writing/localization prevails and besides</review>
      <review>it's pretty smooth 75% of the time. You even get a little bit of social commentary on the Japanese justice system (though not to put too fine a point on it - this is a very goofy game with a childish worldview of good guys and bad guys)."]</review>

      <review>music is good even if it's hard to appreciate in context. It's just a bit short; the ending is a bit abrupt although not entirely unsatisfying and the game doesn't get enough time to really flesh out the mechanics</review>
      <review>so getting the rest out of your purchase is left to the speedrun mode</review>
      <review>which suffers from some of the less pleasant bits (club stealth section straight from hell). It's not bad enough to leave you wanting</review>

      <review>'Dishonored\n \n is one of the few games I\'ve ever played where a direct recommendation of "play this with a controller/keyboard and mouse" cannot be made. Generally speaking</review>
      <review>I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth</review>
      <review>like racing games</review>
      <review>is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard</review>
      <review>all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good</review>
      <review>you\'re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion</review>
      <review>it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night. If that\'s how you choose to play\n \n Dishonored\n \n</review>
      <review>I recommend it. Leaning and inventory management can feel a little less natural than they would on a keyboard</review>

      <review>"A really good immersive sim with a focus on high-tier stealth gameplay. I really enjoyed both playthroughs</review>
      <review>but I really felt the good and bad hasn't aged as well. I wish it was more morally ambiguous</review>

      <review>well</review>
      <review>assassinating someone. The world was decent as well but I felt like it was lacking in some aspects</review>

Unlike the previous games, this installment takes place in a large outdoor jungle. Snake is able to use camouflage, climb trees, hide in tall grass or wear clothes that make him less noticeable.</summary>

    <summary>Kingdom Hearts is an action role-playing game developed and published by Squaresoft for the PlayStation 2. It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square. Kingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position. The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.</summary>

    <summary>In the future, humans have left Earth and settled throughout the galaxy. On Mars, the Union Aerospace Corporation has established a radioactive waste facility and allowed the military to conduct teleportation experiments on the nearby moons of Deimos and Phobos. Hours ago, the base on Mars began receiving incoherent distress messages from Phobos, while Deimos has disappeared completely. With all attempts to establish contact failing, you and your team have been dispatched to investigate. Upon arrival, you secure the perimeter as the rest of your team enters the facility. As you stand guard, your radio crackles with the sound of gunfire, cracking bones and blood-curdling screams and eventually falls silent. Alone, with no way off the planet or means to defend yourself other than your trusty pistol, there’s only one way out - into the complex of death and the horrors that await you within. If you plan to get out of here alive you must fend off the hordes of demonic imps, haunting spectres and your undead, former comrades waiting to tear you limb from limb. So, grab the nearest shotgun and blast your way out of this fragging madness!</summary>

Seven different stories featuring different protagonists, time periods, and gameplay styles await. In The Wild West, a wanderer with a bounty on his head fights for his life. In the Twilight of Edo Japan, a shinobi undertakes a secret mission. Experience these tales in any order you choose—the adventure is yours to control. What other stories will you uncover on the horizon...?</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["A really solid anthology of mini gold era Square RPGs lost to time</review>
      <review>now easily accessible via this HD2D remake. Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Square's Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesn't play by the book."</review>
      <review>'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways</review>
      <review>and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways</review>
      <review>so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game</review>
      <review>but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game</review>
      <review>but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho</review>
      <review>I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me</review>
      <review>each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively</review>
      <review>and while it’s far from a difficult game</review>
      <review>each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake</review>
      <review>it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others</review>
      <review>I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters</review>
      <review>I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.'</review>
      <review>"Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that I'd honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at. The battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people (it was a bit of a blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all."</review>
      <review>"Honestly</review>
      <review>there just wasn't enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters don't encourage exploration</review>
      <review>the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved</review>
      <review>and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to</review>
      <review>and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPG's</review>
      <review>even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring</review>
      <review>the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming</review>
      <review>I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome."</review>
      <review>"The best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game."</review>
      <review>'Rough around the edges in the gameplay department</review>
      <review>but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.']</review>

    <summary>Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D, side-scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop-the-loops. The levels contain hazards in the form of robots ("badniks" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground. Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection. The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress. At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues). When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a "Secret Zone" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a "goal block" (which ends the level).</summary>

      <review>["I really enjoyed this one. The story is super interesting</review>
      <review>most characters are multi-layered and more complex than they initially seem</review>
      <review>and how this game handles skills and thoughts is genius. As most reviews for this game have said</review>
      <review>it's really great that failing a skill check does not necessarily mean you're now going through a worse version of the game (in some cases it's even a more fun route). The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media. I personally found myself more engrossed by the game's study of the main character</review>
      <review>who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character</review>
      <review>but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\n \n On that note</review>
      <review>the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane</review>
      <review>and they really don't feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character. Once again</review>

      <review>and I liked the three main subplots. The main story was decent too</review>
      <review>with some dramatic and emotional moments. Combat is a lot of fun too and flying is an awesome mechanic.'</review>

    <summary>Mario Kart Wii is a multiplayer-oriented racing game for the Wii, and the sixth main installment in the Mario Kart series. Mario Kart Wii retains the traditional item-based weaponry familiar with the franchise, where players can select a Mario franchise driver and themed vehicles. As with most racing games, the overarching goal is to place first among other competitors, through the usage of such items and taking the fastest routes to secure the leads. Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities. A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers. Game modes are also present such as the traditional Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial modes.</summary>

    <summary>Resident Evil 3 is a remake of the original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis released in 1999. It updates the story and gameplay for a modern audience. Like the Resident Evil 2 remake, the game uses over-the-shoulder third person point of view similar to Resident Evil 4 and later installments. Players will spend most of their time playing as Jill Valentine, although on some occasions they will assume the role of Carlos Oliveira, giving him more screen time as a deuteragonist.</summary>

    <summary>On the planet Dahna, reverence has always been given to Rena--the planet in the sky--as a land of the righteous and divine. Stories handed down for generations became truth and masked reality for the people of Dahna. For 300 years, Rena has ruled over Dahna, pillaging the planet of its resources and stripping people of their dignity and freedom. Our tale begins with two people, born on different worlds, each looking to change their fate and create a new future. Featuring a diverse cast of characters, intuitive and rewarding combat system, and a captivating story set in a lush world worth fighting for, Tales of Arise delivers a first-class JRPG experience.</summary>

      <review>["As a long-time Tales fan</review>
      <review>I had high hopes for this game. And I must say that while there are good highs to the experience (such as the combat)</review>
      <review>there are also awful lows (the 3rd act of the game). The result is a slightly above-average game. If you're here for the combat</review>
      <review>you'll have a fantastic time. Even though it can get repetitive at times</review>
      <review>it's flashy</review>

      <review>'the ending wasðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®'</review>
      <review>"I thought this was pretty good for the most part. The last quarter was a little too frustrating though. I was way underleveled even after completing pretty much all side quests. I bumped it down to easy mode for a bit just to gain some mindless levels. It didn't feel good and I don't remember this being an issue in previous Tales games. It didn't seem to have enough content to provide a smooth leveling experience. Eventually I did beat the final boss and could shelve it but it wasn't the huge satisfying moment I was hoping for.\n \n This was far from my favorite in the series but not terrible so give it a shot if it sounds like your thing but prepare to fiddle with the difficulty near the end."</review>
      <review>"Summary: Great gameplay</review>
      <review>god awful story. It's a nice enough game to play despite how dull the story and characters are up until it faceplants during the final act.\n \n Beating things up is fun enough to where I think most people forgave the flaws (as a cursory look at the reviews here seems to show)</review>
      <review>but I just can't overlook all the issues it has."</review>
      <review>'gameplay is some of the best Tales has seen so far</review>

    <summary>Super Mario Galaxy 2 is the sequel to Super Mario Galaxy and the fourth 3D platformer entry in the Mario franchise. The sequel retains many elements from its predecessor, such as the adventure being in outer space, the element of gravity, and recurring objects such as Launch Stars and Sling Stars. Returning items include the Bee Mushroom and the Fire Flower. However, the game introduces new elements as well, such as the utilization of Yoshi, new power-ups like the Cloud Flower, and the use of a guide within the game for beginner players.</summary>

    <summary>Donkey Kong Country is a side scrolling platformer by British developers Rare in 1994. It featured revolutionary pre-rendered 3D graphics that give the game a very unique look compared to most other games on consoles at the time. The two playable characters featured in the game are the titular character, Donkey Kong and his nephew, Diddy Kong. Together the two swing, climb, jump, swim, cartwheel, ride animals, and blast out of barrels on their way to recover their stolen bannanas from the evil King K. Rool and his Kremling army. The adventure takes you through a variety of different environments and levels that continually change up gameplay. Donkey Kong Country also provides plenty of opportunities for exploration with almost every level having a multitude of collectible, shortcuts, and hidden bonus areas.</summary>

    <summary>What Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of short stories about a cursed family in Washington State. Each story offers a chance to experience the life of a different family member with stories ranging from the early 1900s to the present day. The gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the family members themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death. It's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us. You'll follow Edith Finch as she explores the history of her family and tries to figure out why she's the last Finch left alive.</summary>

      <review>The story in this game is really intrging with Arven and Team Star and while not the best Pokemon Soundtrack it has it's bangers like every Team Star theme. Now onto the negatives</review>
      <review>the game is not well optimized for the switch at all. We have so many problmes both old and new as well as it overheating my switch recently. The Gym Test and raiding Team Bases are boring and monotonous. The Titan bosses are a joke with them being piss easy. I like the idea of an open world pokemon game but this game isn't that at all. There is an order to do things and even then you have to defeat team star bases to traverse further in the region. The Final battle is scrippted and I don't want that in a Pokemon game. I can understand why people like this game and I think it's better then Sword and Shield</review>

    <summary>New Super Mario Bros. is a side-scrolling 2.5D action-adventure platformer game for the Nintendo DS, starring Mario and Luigi. The game features a solo story mode with Mario or Luigi, a two-player wireless game Mario Vs. Luigi, as well as a minigame mode for up to four players. The gameplay of New Super Mario Bros. is very much like that of the classic 2D platformers, mostly Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3, and substantially builds upon them to create gameplay both classic and contemporary. As the game is on DS, the touch screen allows players to store an additional power-up and view the distance still to go in a level.</summary>

      <review>['Fun game with fun power ups. I just wish these new super Mario bros games used different sounds from game to game. This one feels a lot different than the Wii U one as far as the levels go but it sounds exactly the same so it tricks my brain into it feeling even less standout than it already is. This scratched my Mario itch though so good job guys who made this.'</review>

    <summary>Tales speak of an ancient land where creatures the size of mountains, roam the majestic landscape. Bound to the land, these creatures hold a key to a mystical power of revival - a power you must obtain to waken a loved one. Shadow of the Colossus is a majestic journey through ancient lands to seek out and destroy gigantic mythical beasts. With your trusty horse at your side, explore the spacious lands and unearth each Colossi. Armed with your wits, a sword and a bow, use cunning and strategy to topple each behemoth. A remake of the critically-claimed game of the same title. Also from the minds that brought you The Last Guardian &amp; ICO</summary>

      <review>['(Played before 2023)\n \n This game is definitely amazing. It might be lacking in a lot of aspects but that is on purpose</review>
      <review>with some of the best scaled boss fights around. This was a 1:1 graphical update of the game and nothing else</review>
      <review>something I wish more remakes did. Everyone should play this game.'</review>
      <review>'A wonderful journey with beautiful scenery</review>
      <review>creatures</review>
      <review>and concepts. This is truly a marvelous experience. However</review>
      <review>as a game</review>
      <review>it has many downsides</review>
      <review>especially with frustrating controls and gameplay where a single mistake can cost you a lot of time. Although some of the puzzles you have to solve to defeat the colossi were pretty fun.'</review>
      <review>'The intentionally empty open world creates an atmosphere unmatched in any game. This is the first "Strand Like game". The lack of dopamine drip collectables makes it so the player can focus on appreciating the world for what it is instead of having to focus on picking up all the garbage on the ground to level up your fart cannon 0.5 more damage.'</review>
      <review>'A solid remake of a PS2 classic. Despite the game not "wowing" me as much as it could have due to me having already known everything about it on the internet</review>
      <review>it was great to actually play through it myself for the first time. Considering this doesn\'t have the massive slowdown in the PS2 original nor does it have the control issues of the PS3 remaster this is probably the way to go if you want to play SotC</review>
      <review>and you really should play it.'</review>

    <summary>Similar to franchises like Devil May Cry, Rygar, and Castlevania, the game draws its inspiration from ancient Greek mythology and boasts a heavy emphasis on exploration and battle strategy. Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as "Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks. Slight platforming elements and an energy collection system similar to that of Onimusha have been incorporated as well, and players are even able to use certain elements of their fallen enemies as a weapon (re: Medusa's head, for instance, can be used to turn enemies to stone after you've defeated her).</summary>

      <review>but the level design is trash. The puzzling is awkward and annoying</review>
      <review>you barely explore the city and spend most of your time in one area</review>
      <review>and Ares looks really silly. The powers you get are cool for the most part</review>
      <review>but there isn't much else that is enjoyable about this game outside of the character you play and some of the soundtrack. Oh</review>
      <review>and the alternate costumes. The alternate costumes are great."</review>
      <review>'O jogo é incrível principalmente no começo. O final é um pouco cansativo. Experiência muito diverida</review>

      <review>'Un juego entretenido y con una historia muy simple</review>
      <review>denota inspiración en la saga "Devil May Cry" pero con el añadido de la historia griega</review>
      <review>me parece un título promedio con momentos memorables como el "Los Dioses del olimpo</review>
      <review>me han abandonado" o la ascensión de Kratos al trono de Ares</review>
      <review>pero como he dicho</review>
      <review>es una historia simple que no viene a tener grandes conflictos internos de personajes o externos de la obra</review>
      <review>en cuanto a jugabilidad me parece extremadamente sencilla y repetitiva</review>

      <review>para dos ya no.'</review>

      <review>and the music is great. But I can't say this is a great game</review>
      <review>since it has some design decisions that are a little shit. Every Rope and climbing section is bad</review>
      <review>there were only 3 boss fights which was kinda dissapointing</review>
      <review>the Path of Hades I will never like</review>
      <review>there was only 2 magic spells you really needed Posidens Wrath and Army of Hades</review>
      <review>since they do so much damage and are AOE attacks</review>
      <review>Zues lightning and Medusa are situational IMO</review>
      <review>and the game isn't as mechanically in depth as something like DMC</review>
      <review>Bayonetta</review>
      <review>or Ninja Gaiden. Still was a good game</review>

    <summary>Persona 5 Scramble is a crossover between Koei Tecmo's hack and slash Dynasty Warriors series and Atlus's turn-based role-playing game Persona series. As a result, it features gameplay elements from both, such as the real-time action combat of the former with the turn-based Persona-battling aspect of the latter. The game is set six months after the events of Persona 5, and follows Joker and the rest of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts as they end up in a mysterious version of Tokyo filled with supernatural enemies.</summary>

      <review>then this should be my favorite out of the bunch. I logged like 300 or so hours in this as a kid just vibing and nowadays I barely play the series. While exploring the world and looking at the pokemon was fun for me</review>
      <review>I never really got into the whole gameplay loop that much. If I didn't get this game around the same time as a toys r us event giving out free level 100 regigigas to players I probably wouldn't have actually finished this</review>
      <review>as I just had that mfer carry me all the way to the end. It was still fun as a kid to be into the pokemon series</review>
      <review>as through playing this with friends and trading pokemon/messing around with their action replay to get hacked pokemon I have fond memories playing this (even if i was bullied in school for carrying a phonebook-sized strategy guide for this game around with me). It's just that I've realized over time that I just don't like main series pokemon games</review>
      <review>so this game has become inherently less special over time."]</review>

    <summary>Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting. Two expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.</summary>

    <summary>Halo 3 is a shooter game where players primarily experience gameplay from a first-person perspective. Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the "Golden Triangle of Halo": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back. Halo 3 introduces "support weapons", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time. The game's vehicular component has been expanded with new drivable and AI-only vehicles.</summary>

      <review>these are fun big budget games and the treatment of them as a serious competitive format feels more like a sunk cost fallacy than an honest assessment of what these games are capable of."</review>

      <review>improves upon that foundation</review>

      <review>it should have been an insta drop from the first hour."</review>
      <review>'I really enjoyed this game. My relationship with the Metroid series is one of admiration. It’s not my favorite series but there’s lots that I love about it. Fusion is a very fun time. A lot of your Metroid staples are more streamlined and made more linear. You would think this would be a bad thing but it was actually very refreshing. Exploration is a key staple of the series and there is some of that here but sometimes in past games it feels too cryptic and unintuitive. It’s easy to get stuck and I don’t have time to waste now that I’m older lol. The enemy design is great</review>
      <review>the graphics are crisp</review>
      <review>sound design is great</review>
      <review>soundtrack was nothing too amazing. This game has some of the coolest designed bosses and some great fights. It’s fun it’s not super long and the story is interesting. I really enjoyed it and I think you will too. Super Metroid is still my fav but man this was good'</review>
      <review>"Just finished a fresh playthrough</review>
      <review>and... I dunno. Amazing linear game</review>
      <review>if you just get what you need and plow through the story. But the me of today compared to when this came out can definitely see how it's a bit naff as a Metroid experience. The most limited title of them all (save maybe Metroid 2</review>
      <review>which this calls back to a lot</review>
      <review>funnily enough)</review>
      <review>with what is normally a joyous full-powered clean-up turned into a pain in the arse slog.\n \n But... just don't play it like that. Treat it as Not A Metroid and it's great. Thumbs up."]</review>

    <summary>Final Fantasy VI is the sixth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Square. It was the final title in the series to feature two-dimensional graphics, and the first story that did not revolve around crystals. The game gives players up to fourteen playable characters, the largest cast in the series, and features the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system. A party can consist of up to four characters, though some events require the player to assemble three different parties of up to four and switch between them. Each character has a unique command ability, such as Terra's Trance, Locke's Steal, Edgar's Tools or Sabin's Blitz, and can also learn Magic spells from earning AP from battles with magicite equipped. Each character's rare Desperation Attack will randomly activate after using the Attack command when at critical health.</summary>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is a remake of the 1993 game of the same name. Besides the complete graphical and sound overhaul, its gameplay controls have been changed to incorporate the additional buttons the Switch holds as opposed to the 2-button choice of the Game Boy. The overworld map is far more detailed and specific locations can now be marked to be returned to on a later occasion. Additional heart-pieces can also be won, extending the heart meter to a total of 20 instead of the 14 hearts of the original.</summary>

      <review>'Zelda with goombas'</review>
      <review>"Pretty cool game. I like the updated looks since they fit really well with the game's theme and the Mario enemies. Overall</review>
      <review>it is a delightful Zelda and a recommendable introduction to some of the older titles which require more backtracking and exploring every corner of the map to advance."</review>
      <review>'Great update to one of my favourite childhood games</review>

      <review>"I liked this one</review>
      <review>but the dungeons felt kind of underwhelming and forgettable. The puzzles were mostly fun but I just felt they lacked any independent themes. Usually</review>
      <review>I can recall a few standout dungeons from each game but for this one</review>
      <review>I can't say I can differentiate them and I just played it through over the last few days."</review>
      <review>"Artistically</review>
      <review>I love this game. The island setting is really refreshing and Koholint is so lovely to just exist in. The dreamlike nature of the narrative is super different for Zelda and the way it all wraps up at the end is so nice</review>

      <review>give me a Pokemon game that looks like this</review>
      <review>give me a fuckin GTA game that looks like this!! Genuinely what I would love more than anything else in the world is for the Zelda series - after Tears Of The Kingdom to come back to this style for the next mainline game.

    <summary>Assassin's Creed is a non-linear action-adventure video game, during which the player controls a 12th-century Levantine Assassin named Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad during the Third Crusade, whose life is experienced through the Animus by his 21st century descendant, Desmond Miles.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>['In this first game</review>
      <review>the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever</review>
      <review>but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that</review>
      <review>while not lacking in variety</review>
      <review>are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series)</review>
      <review>but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.'</review>
      <review>'Sinceramente</review>
      <review>eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho</review>
      <review>mas</review>
      <review>caramba</review>
      <review>é torturante escalar</review>
      <review>o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista</review>
      <review>apesar de interessante</review>
      <review>não tem quase nada de carisma</review>
      <review>sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\n \n Para um início</review>
      <review>mesmo levando em conta as limitações</review>
      <review>ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis</review>
      <review>e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas</review>
      <review>mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth</review>
      <review>e isso matou a graça de muitas missões</review>
      <review>pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia</review>
      <review>depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse</review>
      <review>ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta</review>
      <review>dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar</review>
      <review>e as vezes os npcs (os loucos)</review>
      <review>simplesmente me empurravam</review>
      <review>eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão. Eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que não fosse obrigado a fazer para seguir com as principais</review>
      <review>que são todas praticamente iguais e nada recompensadoras.'</review>
      <review>"As someone who played Assassin's Creed back in the day</review>
      <review>I have to say that I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand</review>
      <review>I appreciated the game's unique setting and storyline</review>
      <review>which offered a fresh take on the action-adventure genre. The game's visuals were also impressive for their time</review>
      <review>with richly detailed environments and realistic character animations."</review>
      <review>'Weird nostalgia for this one. I remember my dad used to laugh when I mowed the pilgrims over with my horse.'</review>
      <review>"(Played before 2023)\n \n I played this when I was younger a lot</review>
      <review>and I am pretty sure the first YouTube video I ever did was recording me diving into some hay as a child. I then played it again more recently</review>
      <review>a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold</review>
      <review>calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city</review>
      <review>running around and exploring while fighting enemies</review>
      <review>but you definitely felt like there could've been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections</review>
      <review>they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming. Overall</review>
      <review>a fantastic game and I think it has actually aged very well</review>
      <review>especially the parkour. It is also one of the best looking</review>
      <review>early-era PS3 games on the console which should also be mentioned."</review>

    <summary>Judgment is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The game is a legal thriller set in the Yakuza world of Kamurocho and follows private detective Takayuki Yagami as he investigates a serial murder case. It stars Japanese actor Takuya Kimura and employs a fighting system similar to that of Yakuza 0 where players can change into different styles, namely crane-style which is more focused on fighting groups and tiger-style which is more focused on fighting individuals. Additionally, the game features an investigation mode where the player must find traces of the criminal.</summary>

      <review>"Yakuza in all but name</review>
      <review>where Judgment excels is in its story. Even the best Yakuza entries inevitably devolve into a flurry of preposterous plot reveals and ripped off shirts</review>
      <review>but Judgment just about manages to maintain narrative coherence right up to the end credits</review>
      <review>delivering a wholly satisfying and unrelentingly grim murder mystery that kept me guessing until the end. I'd happily slot Judgment into my list of essential video game stories to be experienced</review>

The game differs from most previous installments, which would involve a usual three-country campaign, while Call of Duty: Black Ops features two playable countries (Russia and the USA) but only has an American campaign. Several new features are also introduced, such as dive-to-prone and the available use of a flashlight on certain weapons. Furthermore, the campaign's playable characters now speak while being controlled by the player.</summary>

    <summary>Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version are the primary paired versions of Generation V. Black and White follow the trends set up by previous games in the series. Two player characters (one male and one female) travel a new region, Unova, on their Pokémon journeys. This region is inhabited by various Pokémon, and unlike before, none of those available prior to Generation V can be obtained before completing the main story by defeating Team Plasma. The games' names were revealed on the official Japanese Pokémon website on April 9, 2010, and scans from the subsequent issue of the magazine leaked the following day, April 10. Pokémon Black and White are followed in 2012 by two sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, which are set two years after the events of Black and White. Black 2 and White 2 are the second and final paired versions of Generation V.</summary>

The player controls Link and must make his way through the forests, graveyards, plains and deserts of the Otherworld to find the secret entrances to the eight dungeons and try to restore the broken Triforce. Among the game's mechanics, it was the first time we saw a continuous world that could be freely explored, power-ups that permanently enhanced the main character's abilities and a battery save feature that allowed players to keep their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced action sequences with discovery, secrets and exploration.</summary>

    <summary>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a prologue to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It offers players new sneaking and traversal methods compared to its predecessors, as well as the choice in what order the story events take place by selecting missions by advance. The most important change for this title is the shift to an open world design with a real-time day and night cycle doing away with the linear mission approach of previous games. The game was originally developed as a mission for The Phantom Pain, but an extended development time resulted in director Hideo Kojima splitting the specific portion of the game as a stand-alone product so that players could get early access to Metal Gear Solid V.</summary>

      <review>"If Sony wanted to show the capabilities of the new DualSense controller</review>
      <review>they easily could've done a 5 minute guide which gives you the new features and how you can use them. But instead they went the extra mile</review>
      <review>and made a very fun yet simple game which is both informative and a celebration of PlayStation's history of their technology and game series</review>
      <review>with the levels being themed around different parts of the console and level design being very creative as to how they can show off the new features. This makes for one of the most memorable tech demos just due to how refreshing it is with the ways it teaches you about the PS5."]</review>

It is the semi-sequel to 2009's Wolfenstein, however utilizes very little from the game and drops any direct references to veil or supernatural. To progress through the story, the player battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health. In combat, a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. The player have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which can be used as a tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives the player a wide variety of weapon optionsâ€”they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around.</summary>

      <review>'Do you have a single fact to back that up?'</review>
      <review>"I find myself in the odd position of struggling to write about\n \n 'Deus Ex'\n \n . The game felt longer than it actually was</review>
      <review>engrossing in a way I haven't really experienced. I'd consider myself a good fan of immersive sims</review>
      <review>and it isn't hard to see why this is considered as essential as it is.\n \n\n\n 'Deus Ex'\n \n is by far the most accessible of its peers</review>
      <review>where games like\n \n 'System Shock 2'\n \n or\n \n 'Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines'\n \n had great diversity in buildcrafting and emergent gameplay</review>
      <review>there was always an almost cruel sense that there was a specific—comically unspecified—character that a large chunk of the games were designed for. Perhaps the absence of this ill balancing alone is what made\n \n 'Deus Ex'\n \n more popular than its contemporaries</review>
      <review>but such an assessment perhaps fails to do justice to the feats of design that elevates it so much higher.\n \n\n\n 'Deus Ex'\n \n doesn't have even close to the same sense of aesthetics of other role-playing games of its era. A rather unremarkable soundtrack with no astounding moments of art direction to really speak of</review>
      <review>there is great detail in its real estate but other than that</review>
      <review>one could not find the common constituents of 'game atmosphere' to draw in through naturalistic ways. So why then</review>
      <review>is\n \n 'Deus Ex'\n \n so deeply immersive? Dynamism. Never before has a world felt as reactive as this</review>
      <review>there is only one true instance where the world is not completely open ended to you</review>
      <review>where the 'game of the year' version has made progressing to the level 2 labs of VersaLife impossible to do before returning to Tong. Other than that</review>
      <review>every area puts the ball in your court</review>

      <review>access to areas all remains seamless and alters accordingly. Pick up a key before talking to an NPC who tells you to go get it? Its not just that Denton will be quick to mention this</review>
      <review>its the fact that you could potentially just walk past the NPC entirely and get the move on. There's no disconnect in decision making</review>
      <review>you'll feel connected to Denton the way you should playing a game like this."]</review>

BioShock 2 capitalizes and improves upon the high-quality effects, unique gameplay elements, and immersive atmosphere that defined the first game. It explores more brutal gameplay than its predecessor, with new enemies, weapons, Plasmids, and Gene Tonics.</summary>

      <review>apesar de todas as críticas que eu possa ter a ele.'</review>
      <review>'it\'s been a while since I\'ve have this many mixed feelings about a megaten game. I can\'t say it\'s as bad as people make it out to be - maybe it\'s because I\'ve experience some of the truly worst megaten games so I\'m desensitized to poor quality but I\'ve had fun. Some thoughts:\n \n - the world look fun and visually appealing but the dungeons were painfully bland.\n \n - I liked the artstyle for character portraits and backgrounds and the demons look good in battles but i do not like the character designs.\n \n - Happy to see some of the demons they included in the game</review>
      <review>if a bit limited. It was odd seeing some demons show up at much higher level than usual but that doesn\'t affect the experience of the game at all\n \n - The boss fights were fun. I played on Normal and I can imagine them being pretty challenging in other difficulties. The way they were structured made it really feel like you were fighting Devil Summoners. The challenge quests in the Soul Matrix were a highlight.\n \n - Honestly the story isn\'t that bad. It has some questionable writing moments and you need to really convince yourself that "Soul Hack"-ing makes sense but if you get past that</review>
      <review>it\'s enjoyable. Forget everything you know about SMT: Soul Hackers though\n \n - My biggest gripe with it</review>
      <review>the gameplay. It\'s a fun loop</review>
      <review>it didn\'t outstay its welcome</review>
      <review>but it\'s not for me. I felt the same after playing TMS. For me this game would\'ve been a completely different</review>
      <review>much better experience if we\'d had battle mechanics like in SMT:SH'</review>

He wields a Shovel Blade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly! But, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost. If you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, humor and levity, and real heart… Shovel Knight is for you!</summary>

      <review>but it doesn't make it too challenging. I would give this one a try if you like 2D platformers</review>
      <review>it seriously is a classic."</review>
      <review>'Here’s a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty: do you actively avoid playing games from the pre-3D era because of their lack of availability</review>
      <review>or because their foundation is comparatively primitive</review>
      <review>and therefore jarringly inaccessible? The reason can’t be because these games are locked in an archival vault</review>
      <review>for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon</review>
      <review>fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections</review>
      <review>but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception</review>
      <review>especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isn’t as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their “transcendental experience” to their peers with a Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. Maybe it’s because I spend too much time on the internet</review>
      <review>but I’ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when I was in high school. Older video games</review>
      <review>on the other hand</review>
      <review>are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly</review>
      <review>as someone born in the early 3D era</review>
      <review>many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites</review>
      <review>as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. Conversely</review>
      <review>there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era</review>
      <review>and the shift to 3D left them bewildered. They’ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen</review>
      <review>whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. After a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3D visuals to an almost cinematic extent</review>
      <review>games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. One of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was Shovel Knight</review>
      <review>a 2D side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.']</review>

      <review>["sometimes it feels like a big ask to tell people to play through this just to get to the best final fantasy content that's probably ever been made</review>
      <review>but i do think A Realm Reborn is worth it by itself for the most part. the base game is a really solid MMORPG that respects the player's time</review>
      <review>and allows you to slowly learn its systems in relatively safe environments. the game slowly becomes one of the most elegant and incredibly fun combat systems i've ever experienced in a game</review>
      <review>so even if it seems slow or simple early on</review>
      <review>most classes/jobs increase in speed and complexity</review>
      <review>and the game gradually introduces concepts to you so you can effectively utilize its gameplay vocabulary"</review>

      <review>"A Realm Reborn is alright at the best of times and utterly painful at worst</review>
      <review>but it gets a pass due to preceding some incredible stories that wouldn't be the same without it."</review>
      <review>"It turns out I don't enjoy how MMORPGs work. Triple Triad is great</review>
      <review>though."</review>
      <review>"TLDR: ARR starts slow but gets good. I played and dropped this game the first time before the story got good which is a shame but made the second time around 8 months later an even better experience. I would recommend anybody to play this game if they're willing to be patient when it comes to the story becoming interesting and if they have somebody to play this game with. It's not necessary and this game can honestly be played solo but you're missing out on a lot if you're not interacting with anybody in an MMO. I loved it and I can't wait to start Heavensward when I have the time to devote myself to it."</review>

    <summary>Resident Evil 6 is the ninth video game installment in the Resident Evil series. It continues the struggle against zombies infected by the new highly virulent C-virus. The game uses the same over-the-shoulder view as Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, however with a new gameplay mechanic that allows players to slowly move while shoot. Players can select between three scenarios featuring multiple characters and intertwined storylines, and within these scenarios both stories and action cross paths. At key moments during the game, up to four players can join together online to tackle a specific situation, with some stages seeing the usual partnerships swapped to further increase the depth of gameplay.</summary>

    <summary>Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. The main objective of each round is to clear 25 lines, after which the player moves on to the next round. If the stack reaches the top of the field, the player loses a life, and if all three lives are lost, the game is over. The game lets the player choose the starting stage and round, as well as one of three background tunes. Difficulty is increased throughout the stages by an increase in speed and the addition of garbage blocks in the well.</summary>

      <review>where blocks are pure random so you can get completely screwed by RNG. My major gripe with this game is the controls. Moving blocks left to right is very slow and it feels like the blocks rotate in a way where I keep accidentally misplacing them. No hard drops either. I respect the people that play this competitively for learning how to master the controls</review>
      <review>because I sure as hell had a hard time. Getting the ending of the game by clearing a level 9 speed 5 height B game is a total crap shoot due to the RNG of what blocks you get and the arrangement of the garbage blocks</review>

    <summary>Super Mario 3D World is a 3D platformer action game for the Wii U, and a follow-up of the Nintendo 3DS installment Super Mario 3D Land. The game builds upon the previous installment, following a similar 3D level-design convention inspired from the 2D platformer titles where players must navigate through a linear-designed level within a time limit to reach a level's Goal Pole. One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.</summary>

    <summary>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney − Trials and Tribulations (known as Gyakuten Saiaban 3 in Japan) is the third game in the Ace Attorney series. Players take on the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney known for taking on seemingly impossible cases. While the game focuses on a few specific cases, the overarching story of the Phoenix Wright franchise spans the length of the series, involving obscure characters from large families and intricate webs of lies, plots, and murder. The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.</summary>

    <summary>Yume Nikki is a 32-Bit freeware game created by Kikiyama, a Japanese solo game designer. The game was made using RPGMaker 2003. The game is regarded as one of the most original applications of RPGMaker 2003, and the start of a possible new genre of games. "Yume Nikki" means "Dream Diary" in Japanese, and the game follows a young girl named Madotsuki as she dreams. The goal is to seek out and acquire all 24 'Effects'. The game otherwise has no plot, and nearly the entire game is left up to speculation.</summary>

      <review>"Yume Nikki is one of those games I often point to in conversation with fellow designers as a shining example of how well a video game can capture a specific person's experience. These types of RPG Maker horror games usually get a bad rap; they are often cheap products made by inexperienced designers who believe that mashing teenage girl protagonists with horrific set pieces will instantly make a work profound. Yume Nikki does not deserve to be lumped in with the contemporaries. Kikiyama</review>

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?</summary>

    <summary>Pokémon White Version and Pokémon Black Version are the primary paired versions of Generation V. Black and White follow the trends set up by previous games in the series. Two player characters (one male and one female) travel a new region, Unova, on their Pokémon journeys. This region is inhabited by various Pokémon, and unlike before, none of those available prior to Generation V can be obtained before completing the main story by defeating Team Plasma. The games' names were revealed on the official Japanese Pokémon website on April 9, 2010, and scans from the subsequent issue of the magazine leaked the following day, April 10. Pokémon Black and White are followed in 2012 by two sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, which are set two years after the events of Black and White. Black 2 and White 2 are the second and final paired versions of Generation V.</summary>

    <summary>In September 2006, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, featuring new scenes and gameplay elements. Like the first re-release, this version would combine English audio with Japanese text and also use the "Sanctuary" theme song instead of "Passion". New cutscenes, however, used Japanese voice acting, as they mostly featured Organization XIII members from Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories who did not yet have English voice actors; these scenes were later re-dubbed into English for the HD 2.5 Remix release.</summary>

      <review>"To many this is the best game out of the entire Kingodm Hearts series</review>
      <review>and to be fair there's a lot going for this game. As with many Square Enix games</review>
      <review>they always deliver when it comes to music &amp; overall aesthetics</review>
      <review>especially when compared to KH1 &amp; other Final Fantasy titles. The gameplay is greatly improved upon over Kingdom Hearts 1 in almost every regard: camera</review>
      <review>movement</review>
      <review>combat</review>
      <review>platforming; everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed. With that being said</review>
      <review>this is where the story begins to take a nosedive in every direction. I personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay</review>
      <review>which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the Roxas portion of the game. Without skipping cutscenes</review>
      <review>it's going to take a long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable."</review>
      <review>"In my review of KH1 I remarked on how if I played these games as a kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites</review>
      <review>mostly due to how the game had a sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was a Disney title. This game felt like it had a better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes Disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime-ass vibes that Square Enix was known for. Combined</review>
      <review>those two elements make for a game that I feel if I had played as a kid</review>
      <review>it would have changed things the same way Sonic Adventure 2 did for me. That right there is a powerful energy that I can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone. Unfortunately</review>
      <review>I played this a little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally</review>
      <review>but I absolutely recognize that power when I see it. The game pretty much improves upon the first in every way</review>
      <review>with better locales</review>
      <review>fancier and flashier gameplay</review>
      <review>a more intricate plot</review>
      <review>the whole nine yards. My only major gripe that I have with it is I think the second half could have been streamlined a bit better</review>
      <review>and they could have made both acts for each world happen in a row rather than having you go through every world twice. Outside of that</review>
      <review>this is a particularly special game. Which is certainly something I never thought I'd say about a mfin game where a bunch of edgy cloaked dudes and mickey mouse share the same screen space."</review>

    <summary>Falling asleep at 3AM, you close your eyes to the cheesy commercial of Dr. Pierce's dream therapy program. You wake up in an unfamiliar environment, only to realize that you're stuck in a dream - a dream where perception is reality. Welcome to Superliminal. Superliminal is a first-person puzzle game inspired perspective and optical illusions. Players tackle impossible puzzles by thinking outside the box and learning to expect the unexpected. This game features a wonderfully subdued world, an intriguingly voiced narrative, and things that are really weird.</summary>

      <review>'mó brisado'</review>
      <review>'Acabare con todas las maquinas expendedoras del universo lo juro.'</review>
      <review>'I remember back when this was a concept video</review>
      <review>and was super intrigued by the gameplay mechanics. I\'m glad that the game actually found a final version</review>
      <review>and wasn\'t just a concept with nothing done with it! As for the actual game itself</review>
      <review>it was neat. I liked how they focused a lot on perspective based puzzles not only with the main gimmick of resizing objects based on perspective</review>
      <review>but also with things like lighting and making 2D objects 3D</review>
      <review>and resizing yourself to solve puzzles. However</review>
      <review>there definitely were a lot of points where you are just walking through hallways</review>
      <review>which felt like padding. It seems like while the game concept was really cool</review>
      <review>there really wasn\'t a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game "the next portal" like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off. That being said</review>
      <review>Portal is a really high bar</review>
      <review>so not reaching that expectation does not a bad game make</review>
      <review>since this game is still definitely worth playing IMO. The story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics</review>
      <review>which was cool. All in all</review>
      <review>it didn\'t disappoint and I would recommend giving it a play!'</review>
      <review>'Up there with the Portal Series as one of the best puzzle games for me. I\'m not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one "thing" like portals or in this case</review>
      <review>perspective</review>
      <review>means that it\'s not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do. Each puzzle is really cool obviously</review>
      <review>the use of perspective to fiddle with objects is trippy and fun to just mess with. My personal favorite part of the game was the level design and the way it made you feel like you were spiraling ever deeper in a dream. From the endlessly carpeted halls of a hotel to spooky dimly lit backrooms I was on the edge of my seat on this ride. At the very climax of the game</review>
      <review>when you have been spiraling ever deeper trapped in this dream</review>
      <review>the entire thing is kind of thrown away. While the ending still works (avoiding too much for spoilers) it was a bit of a punch in the gut to go from OH MY GOD IM DYING to its all good its the end :). Still I think this game is one of my favorites and everyone should play it.'</review>

      <review>"The Persona series</review>
      <review>along with its parent series Shin Megami Tensai</review>
      <review>have generally been consistent with their themes throughout the years. The collective unconscious</review>
      <review>the masks that people wear to conceal their true selves</review>
      <review>and references to ancient Greek and Japanese mythology are all motifs that are usually present in SMT and Persona games. This has led to a consistently murky tone throughout the series</review>
      <review>in the undertones when not overtly. While the darkest game in the series is up for debate</review>
      <review>there's no debating which is the brightest: Persona 4. Released just 2 years after the decidedly grim Persona 3</review>
      <review>and on the same engine</review>
      <review>P4 delivers an overall joyful and optimistic tone that helped it stand out not only from its predecessor</review>
      <review>but from previous Persona and SMT games as well. This may seem counter-intuitive</review>
      <review>as the focus of the story is on finding a murder suspect who kills 2 people within hours of the game's beginning. Yet it's the moment-to-moment dialogue</review>
      <review>the soundtrack</review>
      <review>even the color palette (the yellow theme provides an overall sunny disposition) that makes Persona 4 not only a joyful experience</review>
      <review>but a joy to experience."]</review>

Super Smash Bros. is a departure from the general genre of fighting games: instead of depleting an opponent's life bar, the players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken.</summary>

    <summary>Super Mario 64, the classic 3D platformer for the Nintendo 64, arrives on the Nintendo DS with all-new features that take advantage of the portable system's dual screens, touch screen, and wireless multiplayer capability. Like the original game, Super Mario 64 DS challenges you to find all the power stars hidden throughout the royal castle in the effort to free Peach imprisoned inside the castle. This time, you can play as Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi, each of whom has unique abilities. Overcome the challenges on your own or battle up to three of your friends in the multiplayer modes.</summary>

    <summary>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a open world third-person action role-playing video game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium. The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life. The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor. The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier. A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.</summary>

      <review>iconic boss fights that provide decent challenge</review>
      <review>more variety in the obtainable powers and improved difficulty balancing alongside another incredible banger of a soundtrack. I can totally see why this game gets the (well-deserved) praise that it gets. A legitimately fun game that I could totally see myself playing more in the future whereas I never want to touch the first Mega Man ever again.'</review>
      <review>'Without a single doubt superior to the first game</review>
      <review>this is the true seminal episode. Includes everything that other Mega Man games will do. Level design is great</review>

      <review>it has some super banging music</review>
      <review>and the weapons are overall an improvement in usability and variety. truly a classic and one of the downright coolest mega man games'</review>
      <review>"Mega Man 2 is an NES game where nowadays you can actually finish the game on a first playthrough without using save states or banging your head on a wall due to how difficult it is. MegaMan 2 is a very balanced game with very good platforming and levels. It fixes the issues of Mega Man 1</review>
      <review>which aren't many aside from NOT being janky and difficult as the 1st game. This is officially one of my favorite NES games and I heavily recommend playing it if you want to get into the Mega Man franchise"</review>

      <review>you would know that this is without a doubt the most popular and beloved game in the entire franchise</review>

      <review>"One of the first games that I was given for my PlayStation 4 was a physical copy of\n \n Infamous: Second Son\n \n</review>
      <review>but because my console's disc drive got clogged up with dust at one point</review>
      <review>I wasn't able to play it (or any other physical PS4 game</review>
      <review>for that matter) for years. Now that I finally got that fixed</review>
      <review>I started playing through this game shortly after beating\n \n Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\n \n</review>
      <review>and while I wouldn't consider this to be a terrible game</review>
      <review>I wouldn't exactly say that I liked it.\n \n Infamous: Second Son\n \n is one of the most aggressively milquetoast games I've ever played</review>
      <review>as almost everything about it feels designed to be just competent enough to keep the player from switching the game off without actually being all that noteworthy. The generic visual style and music really didn't help with this</review>
      <review>as it just made the game generally feel much more bland and flavorless. Like a lot of these kinds of games</review>
      <review>\n \n Infamous: Second Son\n \n focuses on the player having to fight yet another force of tyranny</review>
      <review>and every plot point and character relationship within that journey is as predictable as they can be. None of the characters were very interesting</review>
      <review>but my least favorite was easily the protagonist</review>
      <review>because on top of the obviously bad idea of making him be part of a fictional Native American tribe</review>
      <review>Delsin Rowe was also just annoying</review>
      <review>as his constant quips and one-liners consistently got on my nerves."</review>
      <review>"This game is what validated my PS4 back when it came out. Visually it still looks great with a lot of good lighting and particle effects. Either that or I'm still just easy to please. The plot is pretty cool too</review>
      <review>as you play as some rebel dude tryin to overthrow the authority with his elemental powers. As your character can steal elemental powers from other people</review>
      <review>there's a lot of different abilities you can use and can switch from element to element on the fly so that's cool. There are also moments where you hold the dualshock 4 controller sideways like a spray can to paint stuff and that goes hard I love dumb controller gimmicks. I had a good time with this one."</review>
      <review>'Any game with a protagonist that can shoot stuff out of his hands and is voiced by Troy Baker is getting a good score from me. The karma system isn’t used as good as in the originals</review>
      <review>but this game still looks and plays fantastic.'</review>

    <summary>Kirby Super Star Ultra for the Nintendo DS re-imagines one of the most beloved Kirby games of all time. The game features new graphics and fully rendered animated cut scenes. With so many adventures waiting to be unlocked, there will never be a dull moment as Kirby runs, floats, copies enemies and uses Helpers to fight King Dedede and Meta Knight. New modes like Revenge of the King and Meta Knight Ultra await, along with classics like The Great Cave Offensive and Milky Way Wishes. On top of the main modes, there are also three new touch-screen-controlled mini-games that can be played with up to three friends via DS Download Play. Not only that, but players can go on Kirby adventures with a friend via local wireless as well.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>['This game is kind of like a clip show. A really good clip show. But a clip show nonetheless. And as with clip shows</review>
      <review>there are a lot of rethreads of previous episodes. And while they are done better here</review>
      <review>it does become a little old.'</review>
      <review>'This is the perfect Kirby game to begin with. Perhaps it is even the perfect Kirby game.'</review>
      <review>'kirby has finally escaped the many years of mediocrity and inconsistency. it only goes up from here'</review>
      <review>"This is Kirby Super Star with a different art style and a bunch of extra modes. I don't like the new art style as much as the original and don't care for the new modes."</review>
      <review>'It\'s not that great.\n \n I don\'t see anyone explaining why exactly they like this game so much but I can only guess because others don\'t intend on making a long analysis on a Kirby game</review>
      <review>or they are biased by nostalgia. I beat this edition and played through most of the original as a kid</review>
      <review>and I can say I never had strong memories about it aside from a few rooms. Beating it now after coming from other Kirby games</review>
      <review>the game is plainly dated and I found myself rushing to just beat it after a while.\n \n The presentation is cute</review>
      <review>the hybrid artstyle and cutscenes are nice to see</review>
      <review>but as far as gameplay goes</review>
      <review>SSU doesn\'t do too much to add from the original — which I definitely have qualms over.\n \n Air movement is very sad in this game. Previous entries weren\'t that great in this either</review>
      <review>but it feels extremely noticable here. Jumps are not as pronounced (wheel still did not have this at the time</review>
      <review>but felt like it could\'ve been included)</review>
      <review>flying (a major trait of Kirby) feels like such a pain in the ass that it\'s better to avoid it over ground movement where possible</review>
      <review>and many of the levels contain claustrophobic designs</review>
      <review>sometimes cram-packed with enemies on top of hazard spam (either with lava or electricity as the main suspects) which all started to blur into one another instead of giving each place an overly distinct identity (aside from stages that were a 1-off gimmick). The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding</review>
      <review>which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds</review>
      <review>killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS</review>
      <review>but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design. One-gap holes you must fall into</review>
      <review>mazes galore and some other unintuitive puzzles (specific lava being passable when the rest isn\'t) drowned my joy out.\n \n I don\'t have much to say about the rest</review>
      <review>everyone loves Marx and Galacta Knight. Meta Knightmare felt the most fun to play and control with the energy system being cool enough</review>
      <review>but I don\'t care too much about the "minigame" direction chosen. I personally prefer a centralized thing</review>
      <review>and each segment didn\'t make me feel like replaying it. I understand why they went this route</review>
      <review>though.\n \n There is no bad Kirby game</review>
      <review>and if managed to 97% the game then it was partially fun enough</review>
      <review>but I have to give it my personal "OK" rating that made it a bit below Squeak Squad. Other games have more to offer and feel better to play</review>
      <review>and all the "hip and cool" concepts of this game are mostly at the end of one\'s playthrough to postpone playing it (if you\'re not playing Kirbies in order). An alright game to spend an afternoon on.'</review>
      <review>'They really took the best kirby game and made it even better. Everything that made the original game great is enhanced here</review>
      <review>in addition to this game having several brand new modes after Milky Way Wishes. This game is the origin of a lot of modern kirby mainstays like Masked Dedede and Galacta Knight. Clearing the true arena in this game was a massive accomplishment for anyone in my friend group who could survive the final 4 gauntlet. Lots of good memories with this game both playing it back then and going back to it now. Truly the pinnacle of the series.']</review>

    <summary>The King of All Cosmos accidentally destroyed the stars and—having recovered—wants the prince to rebuild them. Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King. Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items. Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions. The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.</summary>

      <review>"Katamari Damacy ia just pure fun. Once you learn the controls</review>
      <review>it's literally picking up objects. As you increase in size</review>
      <review>so do your pickups. Racing against a time-limit is somehow relaxing just sucking up the world with ease."</review>
      <review>"I don't have much to say about this game that hasn't been repeated for the past almost 20 years. It's easily one of the best titles on the PS2. Maybe one of the greatest games ever made! The visuals make me laugh and the music makes me cry. The simple concept is just so much fun to play with."</review>
      <review>"honestly one of the textbook examples of what video games can be. Aesthetically incredible</review>
      <review>with both the artstyle and soundtrack being a sensory feast. The gameplay loop is addictive</review>
      <review>and the controls make it easy to learn but hard to master. Conceptually it's incredibly easy to grasp</review>
      <review>as your ball starts small</review>
      <review>and you need to roll things up to be bigger. The runtime is a perfect length where it neither over nor understays its welcome</review>
      <review>and there's enough challenge stages with hard goals to keep the more hardcore players invested. Both stylistically and functionally this game rocks and it is a MUST PLAY."</review>

    <summary>The world is in peril as forces, both good and evil, make a play for the powerful Chaos Emeralds. In Shadow the Hedgehog, you can control Shadow and choose which side to fight for. This 3D platformer lets you use weapons, vehicles, environmental objects, and time and space manipulation to combat your foes. Although it is a 3D platform game as with the more recent Sonic Adventure games, the game's levels each feature up to three different missions (Hero, Dark, Normal) that the player may choose to complete. The game's plot depends on which mission is completed as well as subsequent playable levels. The game stars Shadow the Hedgehog and his quest to recover his memory, a goal he has been pursuing since his debut in Sonic Adventure 2, while an evil alien race known as the Black Arms is invading the planet.</summary>

    <summary>Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is a side-scrolling platform game viewed from a "2.5D" perspective. The player moves the protagonist, Klonoa, along a path in a two-dimensional fashion, but the game is rendered in three dimensions. This allows the path followed to curve and for the player to interact with objects outside of the path.</summary>

      <review>['Did this inspire The Empty Man??'</review>
      <review>"This game was a genuinely just</review>
      <review>great experience. The platforming segments are great</review>
      <review>and for the most part are really well designed</review>
      <review>though some areas not so much. I love the 2.5D style</review>
      <review>and how the levels bend and intersect</review>
      <review>it creates quite a unique aesthetic that I love.\n \n The game overall</review>
      <review>while challenging at times</review>
      <review>very rarely gets annoying or frustrating</review>
      <review>which I'm very happy with. And honestly</review>
      <review>I'd say a solid 70ish percent of the game I had no difficulty at all. I found some of the late game bosses to be some of my favorite parts of the entire game. I really love the puzzles as well</review>
      <review>yet again they're really well designed.\n \n I think the only issue I had</review>
      <review>and this isn't even necessarily an issue with the game</review>
      <review>is that I had bad depth perception</review>
      <review>so sometimes I can't really tell how far away a thing is</review>
      <review>if it's not on the same plane as Klonoa. But aside from that</review>
      <review>this game was an absolute blast to play</review>
      <review>and its ending is definitely worth it."</review>
      <review>"A mountain of classic 90s J-charm smooths over some minor flaws in the moment-to-moment platforming. In the tradition of all the best side-scrollers</review>
      <review>your set of abilities is narrow but they are perfectly defined</review>
      <review>taught</review>
      <review>and explored to their limits by game's end. Also manages to be forgiving without being 'easy'. Good stuff!"</review>
      <review>"I know this game has a lot of reviews already on this site but this was a very great game so why not. Klonoa has always one of those series I've been meaning to try more of. But before I talk about the game</review>
      <review>thought I'd share my history with the series."</review>

    <summary>Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story is the third game in the Mario &amp; Luigi series of games. Players control Mario and Luigi simultaneously in the side-scrolling platform environment of Bowser's body, while also controlling the Koopa King himself in the top-down world of the Mushroom Kingdom. Similar to games like Earthbound, enemy encounters are seen as actual enemies that players can avoid or attempt to strike early. The actual battles are a combination of turn-based menu attacks, and timed reactions to enemies during battle. By watching the way an enemy reacts, you can anticipate their attack and avoid it or counterattack.</summary>

      <review>playing this DLC was special. Being with all the companions I had</review>
      <review>finally relaxed and seeing them happily talk to each other</review>

      <review>"i redownloaded the game on PS5 since they recently added an update that adds 60FPS to new gen consoles and i still have the same exact gripes i had with it the last time i played in that the core gameplay is actually very fun but the missions are okay at best and a slog at worst which gets even worse when the game forces you to play story missions by having a squad come out of nowhere and kidnap you and you weren't prepared at all. the DLCs are all not worth buying except maybe the vietnam one just for the weapons you can use ingame</review>
      <review>which make more sense to be in the game than some of the strange choices floating around in the base game. also the story is really dumb and the twist ending</review>
      <review>while ballsy to do in a big AAA title</review>
      <review>makes the whole game's story pointless and paints the big evil cult that kidnaps and brainwashes and tortures people completely in the right. the ONLY thing i could recommend for this game is the arcade mode</review>
      <review>which has a wonderful in depth custom map editor which gives you a lot of freedom and even has various assets from other ubisoft titles that you can play with which all of that results in one of the best custom map features ever put in a modern AAA title</review>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess was initially developed with the Nintendo GameCube in mind, but ended up receiving a Wii port when it was released to promote the new console. This version has motion control compatibility for the sword and pointer controls for the menus, the bow and the boomerang. This version of the game has a completely inverted map and locations when comparing with the GameCube release. The change in layout was meant to adapt Link's usually left-handed design to right-handed people, given the motion controls.</summary>

    <summary>ASTRAL CHAIN, a brand new action game from PlatinumGames, exclusive to Nintendo Switch! As part of a police special task force, it’s up to you to fight against mysterious, alien-like creatures who have invaded the world.</summary>

      <review>['Me esperaba un combate mucho más profundo</review>
      <review>complejo y difícil y no ha sido para tanto y una cosa que me molesta de estos juegos donde hay un boton de esquivar y si le das eres inmune aunque el ataque te haya dado de lleno.\n \n La historia esta bien</review>
      <review>pero la manera en como solucionas las cosas es liandote de ostias con todo el mundo.\n \n Hay una materia que esta absorbiendo la humanidad y la manera en la que limpias la tierra de eso es pegándole a todo el mundo.\n \n También noto que la historia esta apresurada.\n \n Cuando entras en la zona 09 te encuentras un pavo que mola mil que tiene pensado rebelarse contra los gobernantes pero después de ese episodio no vuelve a aparecer.\n \n La tía malvada nunca deja claro que por qué esta creando tanto monstruos salvo para destruir al malo.\n \n Y lo mismo le pasa al malo final</review>
      <review>que su plan es absorber todo para que él absorba ese recipiente y convertirse en dios</review>
      <review>pero habla de que asi la humanidad alcanzará un nuevo nivel cuando el único que "evoluciona" es él ya que los demás son absorbidos.\n \n Ni la historia ni la jugabilidad es algo destacable</review>
      <review>y se aleja de la gran obra de platinum game que la gente me ha vendido</review>
      <review>pero aun así es un juego disfrutable con un gran apartado artístico</review>
      <review>tanto en lo visual como en su maravillosa banda sonora.'</review>
      <review>'God made me buy this video game. I know it was God and not Satan because I did not enjoy playing this game at all.'</review>
      <review>"Ever since this game was announced</review>
      <review>it's been in the back of my mind. It got a lot of attention at release</review>
      <review>with a lot of people review bombing it because of its Switch exclusivity... for some reason. It's even weirder because no one talks about this game nowadays. Ironically</review>
      <review>I think it being an exclusive kind of brought more people to it. It certainly stands out when next to Mario and Zelda and most other switch exclusives. Regardless</review>

      <review>'In 2019</review>
      <review>Platinum Games was coming off their biggest hit yet. NieR: Automata was adored by fans and critics alike</review>
      <review>and expectations were high for their next project. So naturally</review>
      <review>Nintendo fans who missed out on NieR were excited when in early 2019</review>
      <review>a console exclusive developed by Platinum Games called Astral Chain was announced for the Switch. While critically praised upon release</review>
      <review>this game unfortunately ended up feeling like more of a step back than a step forward for the developer.']</review>

    <summary>DmC: Devil May Cry is the fifth game in the hack-and-slash third-person action series and the first not largely developed by Capcom. This title is a reimagining of the series, with the same protagonist Dante, but set in an alternate universe. The Dante in this game is very different from before, doing away with the trademark white hair and altering the main character as well as the game's tone with a much more Western influence. The gameplay is still largely identical as Dante engages many opponents with a fast fighting style, stringing together combos and hits in quick succession.</summary>

      <review>['Dmc Devil may cry é um jogo bem sólido</review>
      <review>com uma das melhores gameplays da série</review>
      <review>e as melhores e mais divertidas seções de plataforma. A gameplay é muito boa</review>
      <review>com muitos combos fluidos e variedade da armas</review>
      <review>como parte fundamental dessa estrutura a troca rápida de armas durante um combo. Porém mesmo sendo um game muito gostoso de jogar</review>
      <review>os inimigos não acompanham essa fluidez toda e acabam sendo na esmagadora maioria do jogo apenas sacos de pancadas de combos</review>
      <review>o que abaixa e muito a dificuldade do game</review>
      <review>o que pode desagradar alguns ( incluindo eu). No geral embora conte com um ou outro inimigo interessante</review>
      <review>no geral os inimigos não tem metade do carisma da série principal</review>
      <review>o que tbm se reflete um pouco nos poucos chefes do game</review>
      <review>na qual dois em especial são bem criativos e legais</review>
      <review>porém os outros não tem o mesmo tempero que a série clássica. Quanto a história aoesar de um Reboot</review>
      <review>dá pra perceber o cuidado de contar uma história de início mais consistente e uniforme</review>
      <review>diferente da série principal que é uma bagunça tremenda na questão do enredo e cronologia. A história do jogo funciona passando um ar demoníaco mais sujo e pé no chão do que o padrão anime da série original</review>
      <review>o que nesse jogo caiu muito bem. Porém acredito que o maior responsável pelo rage que esse jogo sofreu seja seu protagonista Dante</review>
      <review>que não tem 20% do carisma do protagonista original</review>
      <review>e somada a péssima estratégia de marketing usada na promoção desse jogo na época</review>
      <review>apenas reforçaram a aversão ao personagem</review>
      <review>o que infelizmente se refletiu na repercussão do game. Porém infelizmente fico curioso pra saber quais seriam os rumos da história a partir desse game</review>
      <review>os quais eram promissores.\n \n No geral</review>
      <review>se você gosta do gênero hack n slash e deseja uma experiência extremamente gostosa de jogar</review>
      <review>você vai gostar de Dmc Devil may cry.'</review>
      <review>'Skip story cutscenes and the combat is fun (albeit simpler than earlier entries)'</review>
      <review>'Melhor DmC'</review>
      <review>"(Played before 2023)\n \n Good music</review>
      <review>fun to kill demons. That somes up all the positives. I hate Dante's new design</review>
      <review>I hate the 'teleported into demon world' because it makes every level feel exactly the same</review>
      <review>and the platforming wasn't that interesting. This was the first DMC game I played</review>
      <review>and probably why I've never really gotten into the series."</review>
      <review>'Install an "El Donte spanish sombrero dante" mod for this shit and play it with a friend</review>

    <summary>Dragon Age: Origins is a third-person role-playing game described as a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights franchises. Players create their own character by customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class. Combat is in real time with the ability to pause at any moment: tactical options include an editor which allows the player to give the AI detailed instructions on how to behave in every possible situation. Although the main storyline is the same for every character created, the game features six unique prologues, two for each race. Dragon Age: Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system.</summary>

The learning curve is a little steep and I\'d probably recommend playing on one of the easier difficulties if it\'s your first time playing something like this but I think it\'s worth it for all the fun risk/reward it provides.\n \n I will say some of the quests run on a bit long and I can think of at least one quest I\'d remove entirely\n \n cough\n \n the Tower fade quest\n \n cough\n \n . Most of them are very great with a lot of intriguing moral and political choices to navigate. The cast is great and they all bounce off each other incredibly well. It\'s always a treat seeing how each will react to different choices on new playthroughs.\n \n If there\'s one thing that really does suck about the game is the lack of support this game gets from EA. I definitely think it needs a remaster way more than Mass Effect ever did. I\'d also argue that while most of the key characters looked good at launch</review>
      <review>most of the npcs looked pretty rough The sheer amount of mods I have running on this game to make it look good on modern monitors would make most players heads spin. Don\'t get me wrong</review>
      <review>it\'s not like Jade Empire</review>
      <review>where it\'s totally unplayable without fixes but it\'s not exactly the best impression if you just play vanilla. We\'ll probably get a remaster someday. I just hope they don\'t sand all the edges down in the process though.\n \n Anyways</review>

    <summary>Adventure into a world of unparalleled depth and danger with SquareSoft's Vagrant Story. In this sweeping dungeon-crawling epic you play as Ashley Riot, a young assassin and spy for the organization known as Riskbreakers. Your goal is to unravel a deep and twisted plot and come to terms with the recent death of your wife and child. If this sounds a bit too cerebral never fear. Your path to recapturing your sense of humanity hinges on the destruction of countless vicious monsters and the exploration of dark and dangerous dungeons. Vagrant Story is awash in gorgeous scenery and features designs from Yasumi Matsuno and Akihiko Yoshida, the acclaimed artists and creators behind Final Fantasy Tactics.</summary>

      <review>but with the release of Vagrant Story in 2000</review>
      <review>the "action" aspect was amplified</review>
      <review>and the RPG aspect was significantly toned down. Players expecting a similar experience to previously mentioned games would be in for a big surprise</review>

    <summary>Sonic Colors, titled Sonic Colours in European and Australian markets, is a platforming game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega in 2010. The game was released worldwide for the Wii in November 2010. Another version featuring different gameplay was also released on the Nintendo DS at the same time.</summary>

      <review>['Recomendado (aunque peca de usar mucho el 2D)'</review>
      <review>"In my short review of Sonic Robo Blast 2</review>
      <review>I mentioned how I didn't really enjoy Sonic that much and how that game was the most fun I had with anything Sonic related."</review>
      <review>'theres some weird levels that arent fast at all</review>
      <review>but most of the levels are pretty good. i like the aesthetic</review>
      <review>the graphics</review>
      <review>and the music slaps as always. its super short tho</review>
      <review>even for my liking. good game tho. even when the boost trilogy is at its worst</review>
      <review>its just meh'</review>
      <review>"I think the writing is actually all right. Not very good</review>
      <review>but it could certainly be a lot worse. As for the game itself</review>
      <review>it somehow feels both too long and too short at the same time. The Wisps are a neat idea</review>
      <review>and they're fairly fun in execution. And the music for Aquarium Park is great. The bosses are kind of aggressively mediocre aside from the last one</review>
      <review>though."</review>
      <review>"Sonic colors is a bit of an odd game. At the time</review>
      <review>this was the video game that sonic fans desperately needed after critics slammed unleashed and Black Knight</review>
      <review>and people seemed to be pretty happy with this one when it came out</review>
      <review>myself included. However</review>
      <review>I have realized that I don't really come back to this one as often as I do with other sonic games</review>
      <review>and I always wondered why that is. The level themes are all very unique</review>
      <review>the soundtrack is great</review>
      <review>and the gameplay is the boost formula we all know and love</review>
      <review>so why is it that this game didn't stick with me the way most other sonic games didn't? I guess while the gameplay is cool</review>
      <review>most of the level design revolves around controlling sonic in a 2D space</review>
      <review>and I've always been more of a fan of the 3D setpieces sonic runs around instead of the 2D segments in modern sonic levels. That being said</review>
      <review>this game is still very solid</review>
      <review>so I don't think you should sleep on it especially if you like sonic. Just sits in a very weird personal purgatory of mine."</review>

    <summary>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is the second major installment in The Legend of Zelda series and the direct sequel to the first game. Like its predecessor, it features dungeons that must be located in the overworld and searched for an item that will prove useful. However, the game presents many very important gameplay changes compared to the previous one, affecting especially the movements and the combat. Moving around the world map involves encounters with enemies that take place on a side-scrolling playfield rather than the top-down perspective for which the series became known.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>['Another massive adventure that is often looked down due to its difference and excruciating difficulty. It however is a great game with lots of ideas and expands greatly on the original Zelda lore.'</review>
      <review>"I had a lot of fun with this one. Sure</review>
      <review>the game can be a bit punishing on game over</review>
      <review>and the grind to level up is real</review>
      <review>but honestly I was enjoying myself playing this more often than I wasn't. I enjoyed the sidescrolling platforming and I also enjoyed the RPG elements thrown in. The secrets also were somewhat obtuse but not as bad as the first game imo. Still a guide game</review>
      <review>there's no way you are gonna comfortably clear this blind. This is definitely the black sheep in the series given the fact that no zelda game like it was ever made since</review>
      <review>but I think people are a bit overly harsh on it."</review>
      <review>"Couldn't get into it</review>
      <review>long since surpassed by newer games."</review>
      <review>'Beat the second temple and realized the game wasn\'t really gonna change much. To be fair</review>
      <review>it\'s an NES game and there\'s only so much it can do. But man</review>
      <review>when the game feels tedious even with the "cheat code" version that Nintendo put up on NSO</review>
      <review>then you messed up somewhere. I think if they reduced battle encounters by like 50% the entire game would be smoother.'</review>
      <review>'Minha experiência com esse jogo pode ser resumida em:'</review>
      <review>"didn't finish this. actually gave up in death mountain - getting through any of this is like bashing my head against the wall</review>
      <review>and not in any fun sort of way. couldn't even make it this far without creating a new save state after every enemy. there's a lot to like here - the way it looks</review>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the first 3D open-world game in the Zelda series. Link can travel anywhere and be equipped with weapons and armor found throughout the world to grant him various bonuses. Unlike many games in the series, Breath of the Wild does not impose a specific order in which quests or dungeons must be completed. While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method. A lot of critics ranked Breath of the Wild as one of the best video games of all time.</summary>

      <review>were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as "not my style" to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n \n -The repeated backtracking. I get it - a fast-travel mechanic that\'s too liberal can erase the environment</review>
      <review>but this was excessive.\n \n -Some of the charms seemed worthless</review>
      <review>even after strategizing for boss</review>
      <review>combat</review>

    <summary>Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with, and modify a dynamically-generated map made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.</summary>

      <review>fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid-battle\n \n -The lack of freedom to do what you want\n \n -Similar to SMT IV/IV:A (and maybe other SMT/Persona games</review>
      <review>idk) they sell DLC for super powerful personas. In SMTIV at least</review>
      <review>these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal</review>
      <review>they included the DLC</review>
      <review>which again</review>
      <review>I could ignore if they are optional</review>
      <review>but I can't. Unlike in pervious games</review>
      <review>there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally</review>

      <review>I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game</review>
      <review>although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something</review>
      <review>like 5-10 hours more</review>
      <review>and something incredible would happen for sure</review>

      <review>the levels especially alabaster Icelands and cobalt coastlands feel janky and overly linear despite the game encouraging more mobile movement and freedom</review>
      <review>and of course the lack of meaningful presentation through stiff character animations and lack of voice acting hurt this game alot. I still feel like Pokémon gameplay has peaked here but they just don’t let these games cook long enough and only get away with it because Pokémon fans only play Pokémon and don’t branch out to know what’s actually good'</review>

      <review>["Not my fav XB game</review>
      <review>I didn't grow attached to the cast in general and overall I felt that the game always wanted to show me how great it was compared to the others- which I didn't like."</review>
      <review>'I love this video game'</review>
      <review>"Most of the content I consume doesn't affect me emotionally</review>
      <review>but even I experienced an emotional damage from Xenoblade Chronicles 3 because its world was so depressive and the musics were supporting that depressive atmosphere. Thanks to Tetsuya Takahashi's great storytelling</review>
      <review>I found myself caring about the characters</review>
      <review>the story</review>
      <review>and of course</review>
      <review>the world."</review>
      <review>'Woah'</review>
      <review>'This certainly was a long game. For context i have played xenoblade 1dx and seen 2 on youtube</review>
      <review>so i will mostly probobly be comparing it to xenoblade 1. The concept is immedietly quite interesting</review>
      <review>although'</review>
      <review>"hmmmmmmm. Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters</review>
      <review>the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didn't add to much</review>
      <review>if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect</review>
      <review>this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke</review>
      <review>with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though</review>
      <review>it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game</review>
      <review>which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games</review>
      <review>and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series</review>
      <review>but this definitely didn't hit as much as the first or even the second game to me. Still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh..."]</review>

      <review>'Incredible jump to 3D for the Kirby games while still managing to feel like a classic Kirby title. The game makes amazing use of 3D environments to add a new layer of exploration and creativity to every single level</review>
      <review>and I had a lot of fun clearing the main and extra stories with all bonus challenges. While the main content is easy and very chill</review>
      <review>bonus optional content can be very tricky. Only thing I disliked were a few difficulty spikes in some side objectives and the lack of a "restart from checkpoint" button but</review>
      <review>overall</review>

      <review>but also demand perfection for a few bosses. And the forgotten islands prove the developers knew exactly what they were doing - a few enemies get additional move sets that expertly increase the pressure. If anything</review>
      <review>I wanted a dodge move to help me out some more.\n \n I kept Easy on the entire play through and barely scraped by the back part of the game. Yet it’s always changing enemy and levels up enough that it never feels repetitive. If anything</review>

      <review>'Still unsure whether I like the ending or not and for a game with some of the best worldbuilding I’ve ever seen I wish more of the game had to do with that world - but at the end of the day it’s still the best writing any game has ever had so can’t be too mad'</review>

      <review>I kept making bad decisions and throws and even got a game-over. Also the game talks about politics in a deep and serious way so I kinda felt like a kid in an adult game haha. I honestly thought I would just abandonned it but at the end of the day there's this discussion you have with Kitsuragi and he's being very nice and comprehensive and it put me in a good mood; So I just decided to go with the fact that I'm playing a pretty bad cop and continue with the game.\n \n In the end I really liked it</review>

    <summary>Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles. Inspired by cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional cel animation (hand drawn &amp; hand inked!), watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings. Play as Cuphead or Mugman (in single player or co-op) as you traverse strange worlds, acquire new weapons, learn powerful super moves, and discover hidden secrets. Cuphead is all action, all the time.</summary>

      <review>but it still didn't quite enamour me like I'd wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen</review>
      <review>often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information</review>
      <review>so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything</review>
      <review>more of a personal one."]</review>

      <review>["Im waiting for this game to grab me but it hasn't happened yet.\n \n I dont know why I enjoy dying to the same boss for 3 hours in Soulsborne games but not in this game."</review>
      <review>'Loved this a lot. I missed the sense of exploration from Dark Souls</review>
      <review>but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it. Other than a basic whole number for your damage and health</review>
      <review>there\'s no worrying about RPG values here. It\'s a true action game taking place within the open-world Metroid-ish Souls structure</review>
      <review>backed up with\n \n some\n \n items and buffs and junk if you decide to use them. But the lack of gear is probably the best thing about this - no armour sets</review>
      <review>no elemental stats</review>
      <review>no sword that deals +5 damage but -2 stamina. Funnily enough</review>
      <review>people say this is the hardest FromSoftware game</review>
      <review>but after a while it felt much</review>
      <review>much easier to me than Dark Souls\n \n because\n \n there was nothing in my way except my own skill</review>
      <review>which I greatly prefer. No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I don\'t like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better</review>
      <review>because then it\'s this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled</review>
      <review>or I said "screw it"</review>
      <review>summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly</review>
      <review>once you get that perfect parry timing down</review>
      <review>sometimes victory comes so fast that it\n \n almost\n \n feels unsatisfying. Happened to me with the final boss</review>
      <review>funnily enough.'</review>
      <review>'It only took me three playthroughs but I finally like this game! Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout</review>
      <review>though</review>
      <review>which isn\'t new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a "correct" way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble</review>
      <review>but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you that\'s bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing that\'s bad and sucks</review>
      <review>and that\'s bad and sucks.'</review>
      <review>"Toujours en balance avec Bloodborne et Dark Souls pour le titre de meilleur jeu de chez FromSoftware. Une caméra un peu capricieuse par moments mais sinon c'est intestable."</review>

    <summary>Final Fantasy VII is the seventh main installment in the Final Fantasy series, and was the first title to feature three-dimensional graphics, pre-rendered backgrounds and numerous full motion videos. The gameplay is a departure from previous entries in the series in many ways. Though it retains the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system, FFVII features three party members rather than four. The Materia system allows the player to customize each party member's abilities to their liking, and the Limit system grants them unique combat skills. Though minigames had been a recurring feature, FFVII introduces numerous new ones, many of them playable in the theme park Gold Saucer varying from racing with Chocobos to snowboarding.</summary>

    <summary>Resident Evil 2 is a remake of 1998's Resident Evil 2. The game was not developed with the intent of improving the original, but rather a reimagining of the original story with redesigned maps, characters and story elements. Gameplay mechanics are more similar to Resident Evil 7: Biohazard though with the use of an over-the-shoulder camera.</summary>

      <review>["I remember not thinking too much about the original RE2. Don't get me wrong</review>
      <review>it's a great game</review>
      <review>but with REmake</review>
      <review>RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch</review>
      <review>but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever</review>
      <review>with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this</review>
      <review>being incredibly realistic yet stylized</review>
      <review>even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasn't worth it because the story barely changed</review>
      <review>but that's completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories</review>
      <review>but they also have different accessible rooms</review>
      <review>gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one</review>
      <review>and although that's also the case here</review>
      <review>both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way. This is easily my favorite RE game (at least until 4 Remake comes out) and one of my top 5 games of all time</review>

      <review>'My entry point of the series (don’t ask) this remake of my first entry of the series and causing it to grow my love for the series in general this game is really really good and I had a fun time overall when playing this game and since I’m rating this out of pure nostalgia of Raccoon City and overall experience I think this game really deserves 5 stars but when playing this game I got really bad luck with its rng of Mr X and some Lickers since they actually keep killing me and at one point made a somewhat of a stun lock move so I have to take out half a star but it’s still worth playing since it is a very beautiful upgrade to the game I played as a kid and it’s as good as I remember'</review>

    <summary>The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game set five years after the events of The Last of Us. The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. He can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The game intermittently switches control between Ellie and Abby, and also briefly Joel in the opening sequence. The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat.</summary>

      <review>\n \n Neon White\n \n is a stylish speedrunner\'s dream. You play as the eponymous "Neon White" as you fight demons to improve your credit score enough to not be vaporized by the forces of Heaven for another year</review>
      <review>in a vague\n \n The World Ends With You\n \n type competition. To assist in your demon hunting</review>
      <review>there are a number of different weapon cards that provide some ammunition</review>
      <review>or a secondary movement ability. While defeating all the demons in a level is the stated goal</review>
      <review>in reality the game is about navigating yourself between platforms</review>
      <review>using the ability of the cards to assist you. The environments are great looking</review>
      <review>and the soundtrack is incredible. The game has an arcade/Dreamcast gameplay loop</review>
      <review>where it\'s incredibly addicting to play level after level</review>
      <review>memorizing the way forward to get the best times. If this game was just a level select screen</review>
      <review>I think it might be my favorite game of the year thus far</review>
      <review>but sadly this game has one major flaw</review>
      <review>and that is the plot. It\'s an incredibly stereotypical anime amnesia plot full of boring psychopathic enemies</review>
      <review>cringy sexual innuendos</review>
      <review>and awful voice acting. Yes</review>
      <review>I know the guy who played Spike is in it</review>
      <review>but this is not his best performance. I ended up muting the voice audio</review>
      <review>and that helped quite a bit</review>
      <review>but the plot still has nothing to offer. If you skip all the cutscenes though</review>
      <review>I think this game is definitely a must play.'</review>

    <summary>Resident Evil 4 is the sixth installment of the Resident Evil series praised as a revolution from the core games. It was the first title to implement a third-person view rather than the original fixed camera angles its predecessors had. Its mechanics have been completely revamped to incorporate fast-paced gunplay, quick controls and shoot-outs involving massive crowds of enemies in more open areas. The brand-new AI system and open environments allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. Resident Evil 4 had one of the most tormented developments in any game, four proposed versions of the game were discarded by the developers before the finished product was released.</summary>

      <review>ele não é só mais um jogo qualquer da franquia</review>
      <review>é a nova direção da série</review>

      <review>mas será que Sonic Frontiers é um bom jogo mesmo com algumas polêmicas ? A resposta é sim</review>
      <review>ele é um ótimo jogo !'</review>
      <review>'Better than Forces and Lost World but that’s not saying much. Overworld was cool to explore but it was trying too hard to be Breath of the Wild. Combat was literally just mashing Y which wasn’t fun. The platforming stages remove the camera control which just makes you fly off the side if you don’t know what’s coming up. At least it looked pretty aside from the generic looking enemies.'</review>
      <review>"Maybe I'll try again in the future</review>
      <review>but this isn't doing it for me. It was alright at first</review>
      <review>but soon outstayed it's welcome."</review>
      <review>'Excited for the sequel assuming they don’t completely change the formula again because this is a really solid foundation that feels fresh if a little bare bones at times. Super fun to run around and the music is really nice. Glad to have a story where the characters take the events seriously without joking every 5 seconds. The story itself is ok</review>
      <review>but the final act is clearly unfinished and rushed has probably one of the worst final bosses in the whole series which really undermines the ending a bit. Excited for the content updates (SEGA needs to give these devs the time and resources to release a game in a fully finished state).'</review>

    <reviews>
      <review>['PEAK. A near flawless game for me and really encapsulates what I love about the medium. Exceptional effort and turned out just as well as I’d hoped. I’ve beaten it 5 times now (granted new game plus with all your upgrades and knowing where to go makes it much easier). I did find it to be very difficult at points and it can be somewhat easy to get lost. Also a vital system for progression can be too cryptic</review>
      <review>but rewarding once you crack it. That’s about my only gripes. Must play game. Gorgeous artstyle</review>
      <review>no handholdy nonsense</review>
      <review>fun gameplay</review>
      <review>top tier OST</review>
      <review>great story</review>
      <review>and an overall perfect action-adventure game. It’s littered with secrets as well so your exploration is rewarded (pay attention to the manual!). Andrew Shouldice goated fr 5/5 ⭑'</review>
      <review>"Tunic is a wonderful 2D Zelda-like that feels like a love letter to the genre. Between an extremely charming aesthetic</review>
      <review>fun and interesting items</review>
      <review>and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery</review>
      <review>it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre. The inclusions of things like a made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were a kid trying to play a game like Link's Awakening. Discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player. I feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game</review>
      <review>so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing. Level design is top notch in this game and I love all the secrets and hidden paths they provide using the game's isometric view. I think the weakest parts of this game compared to its contemporaries is the mood of the game."</review>

      <review>o lo que yo he entendido</review>

      <review>la mecánica de que todo gire en torno al manual y el no poder entender la gran mayoría de la información que tienes o encuentras me ha fastidiado mucho la experiencia. Dicho esto</review>
      <review>no es juego que yo recomendaría'</review>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the fifth main installment of The Legend of Zelda series and the first to be released for the Nintendo 64. It was one of the most highly anticipated games of its age, and is listed among the greatest video games ever created by numerous websites and magazines. The gameplay of Ocarina of Time was revolutionary for its time, it has arguably made more of an impact on later games in the series than any of its predecessors even though they had the same cores of exploration, dungeons, puzzles and item usage. Among the gameplay mechanics, one of the most noteworthy is the time-traveling system. The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well and each of them has certain unique abilities. Ocarina of Time also introduces the use of music to solve puzzles: as new songs are learned, they can be used to solve puzzles, gain access to new areas and warp to different locations. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games but they are not too complex.</summary>

      <review>além de estar mais complexo que o anterior. o stealth é outra mecânica positiva</review>
      <review>mais opções de assustar o capangas e bem mais frenético que o jogo anterior.\n \n Os bosses estão melhores comparados com o jogo anterior</review>

      <review>['Psychonauts is one of the most unique 3rd person platformers ever made. While the story and general creative direction are charming and still hold surprisingly well</review>
      <review>the game does sadly show its age in other ways.'</review>
      <review>'A quirky platformer with brains. Pun Intended.'</review>
      <review>"(Played before 2023)\n \n This is one of my childhood games</review>
      <review>one of the ones that I played as a kid a lot of. I think the quirkiness aged wonderfully</review>
      <review>and it is one of the few platformers that mixes combat and platforming super well</review>
      <review>although there is a little bit of jank to it. The story is unique with a lot of memorable moments and characters</review>
      <review>and if you can get past some awkwardness and a late game that drags on I'd certainly recommend this game."</review>
      <review>"Ended up playing this on a whim after it being in my backlog for so long</review>
      <review>really glad I did. It's aged quite well</review>
      <review>the visuals still hold up as does the unique level design. The writing is really great too</review>
      <review>haven't laughed at a game this much in a long time. I think the pacing is a bit odd but I guess with a game that can be beaten in &lt;10 hours it needs to ramp up pretty immediately. I think the end drags on a bit long but maybe that's just the effect of the Meat Circus on a players psyche...."</review>

After the side-scrolling and RPG-like gameplay of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, the game is a return to the top-down view and gameplay style of the first installment. It introduces major new items to the series such as the Master Sword and the concept of two different worlds, which was revisited to some extent in Ocarina of Time with two distinct time periods rather than dark and light worlds.</summary>

      <review>which I don’t have. I like most every other 2D Zelda more for doing what this game did but better and the only reason I see it top lists is “because it was revolutionary” which isn’t as good a reason on its own to me. Still</review>

Unlike earlier survival horror games that focused on protagonists with combat training, the main character Harry Mason is an average man. The gameplay consists of combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The controller vibration is used to indicate Harry's heartbeat and will vibrate on low health. The player must regularly enter an inventory screen to check Harry's health, use items, and equip different weapons.</summary>

      <review>mas tirando os controles de tanque meio estranhos e algumas coisas que hoje em dia parecem toscas</review>
      <review>acredito que envelheceu muito bem. Os gráficos de PS1 acabam ajudando bastante na atmosfera de terror. Gostei principalmente da trilha sonora e dos puzzles</review>
      <review>que tem uma dificuldade boa que não é nem tão fácil nem tão difícil. O fato do jogo marcar no mapa onde você já foi ajuda muito</review>

      <review>the sound design</review>
      <review>the awkward angles from the pixels on the PlayStation. It is just sooooo god. The only issue I have is the boss fights and some line deliveries</review>

    <summary>Super Smash Bros. Brawl is the third installment in the Super Smash Bros. series and the follow-up to Super Smash Bros. Melee. This edition introduces super attacks referred to as final smashes: activated by destroying smash balls, these feature powerful and often unstoppable attacks, regularly introducing a major transformation of the character. This edition also introduces a brand new adventure mode in The Subspace Emissary which is a side-scrolling adventure in the style of a platformer. It retains all basic mechanics of the Super Smash Bros. series, such as a damage meter, stocks, and Smash-style attacks.</summary>

      <review>'Dishonored\n \n is one of the few games I\'ve ever played where a direct recommendation of "play this with a controller/keyboard and mouse" cannot be made. Generally speaking</review>
      <review>I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth</review>
      <review>like racing games</review>
      <review>is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard</review>
      <review>all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good</review>
      <review>you\'re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion</review>
      <review>it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night. If that\'s how you choose to play\n \n Dishonored\n \n</review>
      <review>I recommend it. Leaning and inventory management can feel a little less natural than they would on a keyboard</review>

      <review>"it just works."'</review>

      <review>"A really good immersive sim with a focus on high-tier stealth gameplay. I really enjoyed both playthroughs</review>

Most of the series' defining gameplay elements have been carried over and as before, Snake must use stealth and wits rather than brute force to infiltrate enemy zones and eliminate his major adversaries. Unlike the previous games, this installment takes place in a large outdoor jungle. Snake is able to use camouflage, climb trees, hide in tall grass or wear clothes that make him less noticeable.</summary>

    <summary>Kingdom Hearts is an action role-playing game developed and published by Squaresoft for the PlayStation 2. It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square. Kingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position. The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.</summary>

    <summary>In the future, humans have left Earth and settled throughout the galaxy. On Mars, the Union Aerospace Corporation has established a radioactive waste facility and allowed the military to conduct teleportation experiments on the nearby moons of Deimos and Phobos. Hours ago, the base on Mars began receiving incoherent distress messages from Phobos, while Deimos has disappeared completely. With all attempts to establish contact failing, you and your team have been dispatched to investigate. Upon arrival, you secure the perimeter as the rest of your team enters the facility. As you stand guard, your radio crackles with the sound of gunfire, cracking bones and blood-curdling screams and eventually falls silent. Alone, with no way off the planet or means to defend yourself other than your trusty pistol, there’s only one way out - into the complex of death and the horrors that await you within. If you plan to get out of here alive you must fend off the hordes of demonic imps, haunting spectres and your undead, former comrades waiting to tear you limb from limb. So, grab the nearest shotgun and blast your way out of this fragging madness!</summary>

In the Twilight of Edo Japan, a shinobi undertakes a secret mission. Experience these tales in any order you choose—the adventure is yours to control. What other stories will you uncover on the horizon...?</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["A really solid anthology of mini gold era Square RPGs lost to time</review>
      <review>now easily accessible via this HD2D remake. Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Square's Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesn't play by the book."</review>
      <review>'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways</review>
      <review>and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways</review>
      <review>so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game</review>
      <review>but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game</review>
      <review>but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho</review>
      <review>I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me</review>
      <review>each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively</review>
      <review>and while it’s far from a difficult game</review>
      <review>each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake</review>
      <review>it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others</review>
      <review>I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters</review>
      <review>I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.'</review>
      <review>"Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that I'd honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at. The battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people (it was a bit of a blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all."</review>
      <review>"Honestly</review>
      <review>there just wasn't enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters don't encourage exploration</review>
      <review>the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved</review>
      <review>and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to</review>
      <review>and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPG's</review>
      <review>even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring</review>
      <review>the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming</review>
      <review>I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome."</review>
      <review>"The best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game."</review>
      <review>'Rough around the edges in the gameplay department</review>
      <review>but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.']</review>

    <summary>Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D, side-scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop-the-loops. The levels contain hazards in the form of robots ("badniks" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground. Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection. The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress. At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues). When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a "Secret Zone" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a "goal block" (which ends the level).</summary>

      <review>["I really enjoyed this one. The story is super interesting</review>
      <review>most characters are multi-layered and more complex than they initially seem</review>
      <review>and how this game handles skills and thoughts is genius. As most reviews for this game have said</review>
      <review>it's really great that failing a skill check does not necessarily mean you're now going through a worse version of the game (in some cases it's even a more fun route). The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media. I personally found myself more engrossed by the game's study of the main character</review>
      <review>who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character</review>
      <review>but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\n \n On that note</review>
      <review>the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane</review>
      <review>and they really don't feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character. Once again</review>
      <review>this contributes heavily into making the player fit into the role-playing aspect of this game more</review>

      <review>['Enjoyed this one a lot as a big Harry Potter fan. The developers have done an incredible job in making Hogwarts make sense and feel lived in at the same time. Love all the elements of lore hinting back to parts of the books</review>
      <review>whilst still feeling new. Some of the characters were very likeable</review>
      <review>and I liked the three main subplots. The main story was decent too</review>
      <review>with some dramatic and emotional moments. Combat is a lot of fun too and flying is an awesome mechanic.'</review>
      <review>'Had a lot of fun playing this ngl. Running around hogwarts was a dream come true</review>

      <review>it is barely enjoyable</review>
      <review>spamming skills and rolling around from hundreds of enemies to... what? To get a new pair of the same-looking rounded glasses (no no no we still do not get that this is a Harry-Potter-inspired game)? 33 copies of the same old black cloak?

      <review>a stupid forest that spread across the Highlands that looks exactly the same at any point of your destination (apart from the small part to the south) to get a bunch of decorative pieces. To be honest</review>

    <summary>Mario Kart Wii is a multiplayer-oriented racing game for the Wii, and the sixth main installment in the Mario Kart series. Mario Kart Wii retains the traditional item-based weaponry familiar with the franchise, where players can select a Mario franchise driver and themed vehicles. As with most racing games, the overarching goal is to place first among other competitors, through the usage of such items and taking the fastest routes to secure the leads. Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities. A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers. Game modes are also present such as the traditional Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial modes.</summary>

    <summary>Resident Evil 3 is a remake of the original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis released in 1999. It updates the story and gameplay for a modern audience. Like the Resident Evil 2 remake, the game uses over-the-shoulder third person point of view similar to Resident Evil 4 and later installments. Players will spend most of their time playing as Jill Valentine, although on some occasions they will assume the role of Carlos Oliveira, giving him more screen time as a deuteragonist.</summary>

    <summary>On the planet Dahna, reverence has always been given to Rena--the planet in the sky--as a land of the righteous and divine. Stories handed down for generations became truth and masked reality for the people of Dahna. For 300 years, Rena has ruled over Dahna, pillaging the planet of its resources and stripping people of their dignity and freedom. Our tale begins with two people, born on different worlds, each looking to change their fate and create a new future. Featuring a diverse cast of characters, intuitive and rewarding combat system, and a captivating story set in a lush world worth fighting for, Tales of Arise delivers a first-class JRPG experience.</summary>

      <review>["As a long-time Tales fan</review>
      <review>I had high hopes for this game. And I must say that while there are good highs to the experience (such as the combat)</review>
      <review>there are also awful lows (the 3rd act of the game). The result is a slightly above-average game. If you're here for the combat</review>
      <review>you'll have a fantastic time. Even though it can get repetitive at times</review>
      <review>it's flashy</review>

      <review>and the best the series has ever been. This is only made better by the fantastic soundtrack. I honestly did not mind listening to the same battle tracks for the duration of my almost 60-hour journey. It's that good."</review>
      <review>"I want to start this by saying that i really</review>
      <review>\n \n desperately\n \n wanted to like this game. Genuinely. I was so excited to start it as I'm quite a fan of the series."</review>
      <review>'the ending wasðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®'</review>
      <review>"I thought this was pretty good for the most part. The last quarter was a little too frustrating though. I was way underleveled even after completing pretty much all side quests. I bumped it down to easy mode for a bit just to gain some mindless levels. It didn't feel good and I don't remember this being an issue in previous Tales games. It didn't seem to have enough content to provide a smooth leveling experience. Eventually I did beat the final boss and could shelve it but it wasn't the huge satisfying moment I was hoping for.\n \n This was far from my favorite in the series but not terrible so give it a shot if it sounds like your thing but prepare to fiddle with the difficulty near the end."</review>
      <review>"Summary: Great gameplay</review>
      <review>god awful story. It's a nice enough game to play despite how dull the story and characters are up until it faceplants during the final act.\n \n Beating things up is fun enough to where I think most people forgave the flaws (as a cursory look at the reviews here seems to show)</review>
      <review>but I just can't overlook all the issues it has."</review>
      <review>'gameplay is some of the best Tales has seen so far</review>

    <summary>Super Mario Galaxy 2 is the sequel to Super Mario Galaxy and the fourth 3D platformer entry in the Mario franchise. The sequel retains many elements from its predecessor, such as the adventure being in outer space, the element of gravity, and recurring objects such as Launch Stars and Sling Stars. Returning items include the Bee Mushroom and the Fire Flower. However, the game introduces new elements as well, such as the utilization of Yoshi, new power-ups like the Cloud Flower, and the use of a guide within the game for beginner players.</summary>

    <summary>Donkey Kong Country is a side scrolling platformer by British developers Rare in 1994. It featured revolutionary pre-rendered 3D graphics that give the game a very unique look compared to most other games on consoles at the time. The two playable characters featured in the game are the titular character, Donkey Kong and his nephew, Diddy Kong. Together the two swing, climb, jump, swim, cartwheel, ride animals, and blast out of barrels on their way to recover their stolen bannanas from the evil King K. Rool and his Kremling army. The adventure takes you through a variety of different environments and levels that continually change up gameplay. Donkey Kong Country also provides plenty of opportunities for exploration with almost every level having a multitude of collectible, shortcuts, and hidden bonus areas.</summary>

    <summary>What Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of short stories about a cursed family in Washington State. Each story offers a chance to experience the life of a different family member with stories ranging from the early 1900s to the present day. The gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the family members themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death. It's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us. You'll follow Edith Finch as she explores the history of her family and tries to figure out why she's the last Finch left alive.</summary>

      <review>the game is not well optimized for the switch at all. We have so many problmes both old and new as well as it overheating my switch recently. The Gym Test and raiding Team Bases are boring and monotonous. The Titan bosses are a joke with them being piss easy. I like the idea of an open world pokemon game but this game isn't that at all. There is an order to do things and even then you have to defeat team star bases to traverse further in the region. The Final battle is scrippted and I don't want that in a Pokemon game.

    <summary>New Super Mario Bros. is a side-scrolling 2.5D action-adventure platformer game for the Nintendo DS, starring Mario and Luigi. The game features a solo story mode with Mario or Luigi, a two-player wireless game Mario Vs. Luigi, as well as a minigame mode for up to four players. The gameplay of New Super Mario Bros. is very much like that of the classic 2D platformers, mostly Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3, and substantially builds upon them to create gameplay both classic and contemporary. As the game is on DS, the touch screen allows players to store an additional power-up and view the distance still to go in a level.</summary>

      <review>['Fun game with fun power ups. I just wish these new super Mario bros games used different sounds from game to game. This one feels a lot different than the Wii U one as far as the levels go but it sounds exactly the same so it tricks my brain into it feeling even less standout than it already is. This scratched my Mario itch though so good job guys who made this.'</review>

      <review>['(Played before 2023)\n \n This game is definitely amazing. It might be lacking in a lot of aspects but that is on purpose</review>
      <review>with some of the best scaled boss fights around. This was a 1:1 graphical update of the game and nothing else</review>
      <review>something I wish more remakes did. Everyone should play this game.'</review>

      <review>as a game</review>
      <review>it has many downsides</review>
      <review>especially with frustrating controls and gameplay where a single mistake can cost you a lot of time. Although some of the puzzles you have to solve to defeat the colossi were pretty fun.'</review>
      <review>'The intentionally empty open world creates an atmosphere unmatched in any game. This is the first "Strand Like game". The lack of dopamine drip collectables makes it so the player can focus on appreciating the world for what it is instead of having to focus on picking up all the garbage on the ground to level up your fart cannon 0.5 more damage.'</review>
      <review>'A solid remake of a PS2 classic. Despite the game not "wowing" me as much as it could have due to me having already known everything about it on the internet</review>
      <review>it was great to actually play through it myself for the first time. Considering this doesn\'t have the massive slowdown in the PS2 original nor does it have the control issues of the PS3 remaster this is probably the way to go if you want to play SotC</review>
      <review>and you really should play it.'</review>

Besides the complete graphical and sound overhaul, its gameplay controls have been changed to incorporate the additional buttons the Switch holds as opposed to the 2-button choice of the Game Boy. The overworld map is far more detailed and specific locations can now be marked to be returned to on a later occasion. Additional heart-pieces can also be won, extending the heart meter to a total of 20 instead of the 14 hearts of the original.</summary>

    <reviews>
      <review>['O Altair parece um mitra do Cerco</review>
      <review>mas de resto gostei muito do drogado'</review>
      <review>'In this first game</review>
      <review>the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever</review>
      <review>but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that</review>
      <review>while not lacking in variety</review>
      <review>are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series)</review>
      <review>but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.'</review>
      <review>'Sinceramente</review>
      <review>eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho</review>
      <review>mas</review>
      <review>caramba</review>
      <review>é torturante escalar</review>
      <review>o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista</review>
      <review>apesar de interessante</review>
      <review>não tem quase nada de carisma</review>
      <review>sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\n \n Para um início</review>
      <review>mesmo levando em conta as limitações</review>
      <review>ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis</review>
      <review>e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas</review>
      <review>mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth</review>
      <review>e isso matou a graça de muitas missões</review>
      <review>pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia</review>
      <review>depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse</review>
      <review>ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta</review>
      <review>dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar</review>
      <review>e as vezes os npcs (os loucos)</review>
      <review>simplesmente me empurravam</review>
      <review>eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão. Eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que não fosse obrigado a fazer para seguir com as principais</review>
      <review>que são todas praticamente iguais e nada recompensadoras.'</review>
      <review>"As someone who played Assassin's Creed back in the day</review>
      <review>I have to say that I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand</review>
      <review>I appreciated the game's unique setting and storyline</review>
      <review>which offered a fresh take on the action-adventure genre. The game's visuals were also impressive for their time</review>
      <review>with richly detailed environments and realistic character animations."</review>
      <review>'Weird nostalgia for this one. I remember my dad used to laugh when I mowed the pilgrims over with my horse.'</review>
      <review>"(Played before 2023)\n \n I played this when I was younger a lot</review>
      <review>and I am pretty sure the first YouTube video I ever did was recording me diving into some hay as a child. I then played it again more recently</review>
      <review>a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold</review>
      <review>calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city</review>
      <review>running around and exploring while fighting enemies</review>
      <review>but you definitely felt like there could've been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections</review>
      <review>they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming. Overall</review>
      <review>a fantastic game and I think it has actually aged very well</review>
      <review>especially the parkour. It is also one of the best looking</review>

It stars Japanese actor Takuya Kimura and employs a fighting system similar to that of Yakuza 0 where players can change into different styles, namely crane-style which is more focused on fighting groups and tiger-style which is more focused on fighting individuals. Additionally, the game features an investigation mode where the player must find traces of the criminal.</summary>

      <review>["Mortal Wounds are an AWFUL mechanic but otherwise</review>
      <review>this is easily the most straight-up fun I've had (so far) with an RGG game."</review>
      <review>'Judge man takes judgement into his own hands. I just wish tailing missions werent a thing. Fun story and character though. RGGS understands why people play their games.'</review>
      <review>"Yakuza in all but name</review>
      <review>where Judgment excels is in its story. Even the best Yakuza entries inevitably devolve into a flurry of preposterous plot reveals and ripped off shirts</review>
      <review>but Judgment just about manages to maintain narrative coherence right up to the end credits</review>
      <review>delivering a wholly satisfying and unrelentingly grim murder mystery that kept me guessing until the end. I'd happily slot Judgment into my list of essential video game stories to be experienced</review>
      <review>up there with the likes of Broken Sword</review>

      <review>tem uma gameplay divertida pra caramba</review>
      <review>história cativante e emocional e uma soundtrack muito gostosa de ouvir</review>

    <summary>Call of Duty: Black Ops is the seventh main Call of Duty game and the sequel to Call of Duty: World at War. The game differs from most previous installments, which would involve a usual three-country campaign, while Call of Duty: Black Ops features two playable countries (Russia and the USA) but only has an American campaign. Several new features are also introduced, such as dive-to-prone and the available use of a flashlight on certain weapons. Furthermore, the campaign's playable characters now speak while being controlled by the player.</summary>

      <review>Blackhole Storm and Cold Snap. The haptic feedback with the weapons all feel great</review>

      <review>the best parts involving the conflicts between the main villains</review>
      <review>and gets quite funny at times. After being quite critical on future era</review>
      <review>I think this is definitely a step forward for the Ratchet &amp; Clank franchise.'</review>
      <review>"It's good to see Sony's classic franchises being brought back. After the original game's remake</review>
      <review>I knew something was coming along and I was right! We get a brand new next-gen exclusive Ratchet &amp; Clank game without the baggage of the PS4 holding it down. The franchise returns to its familiar roots which are both good and bad and I'll explain why."]</review>

    <summary>Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version are the primary paired versions of Generation V. Black and White follow the trends set up by previous games in the series. Two player characters (one male and one female) travel a new region, Unova, on their Pokémon journeys. This region is inhabited by various Pokémon, and unlike before, none of those available prior to Generation V can be obtained before completing the main story by defeating Team Plasma. The games' names were revealed on the official Japanese Pokémon website on April 9, 2010, and scans from the subsequent issue of the magazine leaked the following day, April 10. Pokémon Black and White are followed in 2012 by two sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, which are set two years after the events of Black and White. Black 2 and White 2 are the second and final paired versions of Generation V.</summary>

Among the game's mechanics, it was the first time we saw a continuous world that could be freely explored, power-ups that permanently enhanced the main character's abilities and a battery save feature that allowed players to keep their progress instead of having to start over.

    <summary>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a prologue to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It offers players new sneaking and traversal methods compared to its predecessors, as well as the choice in what order the story events take place by selecting missions by advance. The most important change for this title is the shift to an open world design with a real-time day and night cycle doing away with the linear mission approach of previous games. The game was originally developed as a mission for The Phantom Pain, but an extended development time resulted in director Hideo Kojima splitting the specific portion of the game as a stand-alone product so that players could get early access to Metal Gear Solid V.</summary>

      <review>which I'm honestly fine with and the level is pretty cool all things considered. This game tries to go for a much darker sort of vibe than what usually goes on in metal gear</review>
      <review>and theres some kinda gross scenes that are made grosser by the shiny photorealistic new FOX engine they got going here. Doesn't exactly end on a very positive note either</review>
      <review>but I guess that's to set up the Phantom Pain. All in all</review>

The player is tasked with exploring the witch's lair and the nine large, open levels within it, looking for tasks and challenges to complete. Along the way they meet a variety of characters who teach them new moves and transform them into different animals. Modeled after Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie is distinguished by its cheeky and sarcastic sense of humor and by a large, varied, and novel moveset.</summary>

      <review>'The first time you play this game will be the best experience you have with it. Its insanely scary but also really beautiful. Once you get used to the game it does get a little stale but it will always be a really awesome ocean game.'</review>
      <review>'Fun but empty just like ocean'</review>
      <review>'ok'</review>
      <review>'Great game'</review>
      <review>"Easily one of the best survival games available. The cycle of finding new materials and blueprints and bringing them back to base to build something better to go exploring with provides a constant stream of good chemicals in the brain. Only issue may be the lack of direction near the mid-late period as well as the repeated back tracking when descending deeper. But when I look at the stars I'm reminded of God's infinite love and beauty extends to the high heavens</review>

      <review>but it doesn't have any replabilitiy. I really didn't feel any reason to go back through this game and only came back after my initial playthrough for the DLC which definitely helps me want to replay through it. But you can't really control or change builds to have drastically different play styles. You're still dodging and shooting with an active reload for the most part and that is it</review>
      <review>with the variety coming from the enemies and biomes. I hope we get a sequel that turns it into a true roguelike</review>

In addition to the single-player experience, New Super Mario Bros. Wii also features a multiplayer mode for up to four players. This is the first Super Mario game to feature co-op and vs. modes at the same time since Mario Bros. It features more items, new levels, and more enemies than the DS predecessor. The game introduces two new power-ups, the Propeller Mushroom and the Penguin Suit, which turn characters into their propeller and penguin forms, respectively.</summary>

    <summary>Wolfenstein: The New Order is an action-adventure shooter game played from a first-person perspective. It is the semi-sequel to 2009's Wolfenstein, however utilizes very little from the game and drops any direct references to veil or supernatural. To progress through the story, the player battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health. In combat, a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. The player have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which can be used as a tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives the player a wide variety of weapon optionsâ€”they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around.</summary>

      <review>engrossing in a way I haven't really experienced. I'd consider myself a good fan of immersive sims</review>
      <review>and it isn't hard to see why this is considered as essential as it is.\n \n\n\n 'Deus Ex'\n \n is by far the most accessible of its peers</review>
      <review>where games like\n \n 'System Shock 2'\n \n or\n \n 'Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines'\n \n had great diversity in buildcrafting and emergent gameplay</review>
      <review>there was always an almost cruel sense that there was a specific—comically unspecified—character that a large chunk of the games were designed for. Perhaps the absence of this ill balancing alone is what made\n \n 'Deus Ex'\n \n more popular than its contemporaries</review>
      <review>but such an assessment perhaps fails to do justice to the feats of design that elevates it so much higher.\n \n\n\n 'Deus Ex'\n \n doesn't have even close to the same sense of aesthetics of other role-playing games of its era. A rather unremarkable soundtrack with no astounding moments of art direction to really speak of</review>
      <review>there is great detail in its real estate but other than that</review>
      <review>one could not find the common constituents of 'game atmosphere' to draw in through naturalistic ways. So why then</review>
      <review>is\n \n 'Deus Ex'\n \n so deeply immersive? Dynamism. Never before has a world felt as reactive as this</review>
      <review>there is only one true instance where the world is not completely open ended to you</review>
      <review>where the 'game of the year' version has made progressing to the level 2 labs of VersaLife impossible to do before returning to Tong. Other than that</review>

      <review>access to areas all remains seamless and alters accordingly. Pick up a key before talking to an NPC who tells you to go get it? Its not just that Denton will be quick to mention this</review>
      <review>its the fact that you could potentially just walk past the NPC entirely and get the move on. There's no disconnect in decision making</review>
      <review>you'll feel connected to Denton the way you should playing a game like this."]</review>

      <review>eu genuínamente acho que falam mal demais desse jogo</review>
      <review>apesar de todas as críticas que eu possa ter a ele.'</review>
      <review>'it\'s been a while since I\'ve have this many mixed feelings about a megaten game. I can\'t say it\'s as bad as people make it out to be - maybe it\'s because I\'ve experience some of the truly worst megaten games so I\'m desensitized to poor quality but I\'ve had fun. Some thoughts:\n \n - the world look fun and visually appealing but the dungeons were painfully bland.\n \n - I liked the artstyle for character portraits and backgrounds and the demons look good in battles but i do not like the character designs.\n \n - Happy to see some of the demons they included in the game</review>
      <review>if a bit limited. It was odd seeing some demons show up at much higher level than usual but that doesn\'t affect the experience of the game at all\n \n - The boss fights were fun. I played on Normal and I can imagine them being pretty challenging in other difficulties. The way they were structured made it really feel like you were fighting Devil Summoners. The challenge quests in the Soul Matrix were a highlight.\n \n - Honestly the story isn\'t that bad. It has some questionable writing moments and you need to really convince yourself that "Soul Hack"-ing makes sense but if you get past that</review>
      <review>it\'s enjoyable. Forget everything you know about SMT: Soul Hackers though\n \n - My biggest gripe with it</review>
      <review>the gameplay. It\'s a fun loop</review>
      <review>it didn\'t outstay its welcome</review>
      <review>but it\'s not for me. I felt the same after playing TMS. For me this game would\'ve been a completely different</review>
      <review>much better experience if we\'d had battle mechanics like in SMT:SH'</review>

    <summary>Shovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. It's a hot mashup of new and old! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this land with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and quest for his lost beloved. He wields a Shovel Blade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly! But, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost. If you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, humor and levity, and real heart… Shovel Knight is for you!</summary>

      <review>"You'll love this game if you grew up on NES/SNES games. You'll also probably like it if you just like action platformers in general. Really solid game</review>
      <review>also it is not a metroidvania if thats what anyone is looking for."</review>
      <review>"This game is the poster child for 8-bit throwback games</review>
      <review>and with good reason. It basically captures the NES era of games the best it possibly can while also bringing it up to date with modern design conventions. It's basically the gold standard for those kinds of games</review>
      <review>so if you fancy yourself a nice 2D platformer and want a solidly good 8-bit throwback</review>
      <review>this is your game. Theres also a ton of free bonus campaigns in this game but I still haven't played those yet</review>
      <review>should get around to doing that someday."</review>

      <review>"Shovel Knight seriously rocks. What really shines is the level design</review>
      <review>soundtrack</review>
      <review>and main mechanic of bouncing with the shovel. The death defying jumps make the game stressful</review>
      <review>but it doesn't make it too challenging. I would give this one a try if you like 2D platformers</review>
      <review>it seriously is a classic."</review>
      <review>'Here’s a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty: do you actively avoid playing games from the pre-3D era because of their lack of availability</review>
      <review>or because their foundation is comparatively primitive</review>
      <review>and therefore jarringly inaccessible? The reason can’t be because these games are locked in an archival vault</review>
      <review>for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon</review>
      <review>fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections</review>
      <review>but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception</review>
      <review>especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isn’t as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their “transcendental experience” to their peers with a Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. Maybe it’s because I spend too much time on the internet</review>
      <review>but I’ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when I was in high school. Older video games</review>
      <review>on the other hand</review>
      <review>are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly</review>
      <review>as someone born in the early 3D era</review>
      <review>many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites</review>
      <review>as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. Conversely</review>
      <review>there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era</review>
      <review>and the shift to 3D left them bewildered. They’ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen</review>
      <review>whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. After a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3D visuals to an almost cinematic extent</review>
      <review>games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. One of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was Shovel Knight</review>
      <review>a 2D side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.']</review>

      <review>and allows you to slowly learn its systems in relatively safe environments. the game slowly becomes one of the most elegant and incredibly fun combat systems i've ever experienced in a game</review>

I played and dropped this game the first time before the story got good which is a shame but made the second time around 8 months later an even better experience. I would recommend anybody to play this game if they're willing to be patient when it comes to the story becoming interesting and if they have somebody to play this game with. It's not necessary and this game can honestly be played solo but you're missing out on a lot if you're not interacting with anybody in an MMO. I loved it and I can't wait to start Heavensward when I have the time to devote myself to it."</review>

    <summary>Resident Evil 6 is the ninth video game installment in the Resident Evil series. It continues the struggle against zombies infected by the new highly virulent C-virus. The game uses the same over-the-shoulder view as Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, however with a new gameplay mechanic that allows players to slowly move while shoot. Players can select between three scenarios featuring multiple characters and intertwined storylines, and within these scenarios both stories and action cross paths. At key moments during the game, up to four players can join together online to tackle a specific situation, with some stages seeing the usual partnerships swapped to further increase the depth of gameplay.</summary>

The game plays very differently from its predecessors, as it puts much more emphasis on style rather than simple demon slaying. As such, combat is much more intense and faster than before. An all-new Style system that allows you to select your fighting style has also been incorporated.</summary>

    <summary>Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. The main objective of each round is to clear 25 lines, after which the player moves on to the next round. If the stack reaches the top of the field, the player loses a life, and if all three lives are lost, the game is over. The game lets the player choose the starting stage and round, as well as one of three background tunes. Difficulty is increased throughout the stages by an increase in speed and the addition of garbage blocks in the well.</summary>

      <review>albeit not as iconic as the game boy version. The A-type is your classic endless game of tetris</review>
      <review>and the B-type involves clearing a certain amount of garbage blocks. Plays by "asshole tetris" rules</review>
      <review>where blocks are pure random so you can get completely screwed by RNG. My major gripe with this game is the controls. Moving blocks left to right is very slow and it feels like the blocks rotate in a way where I keep accidentally misplacing them. No hard drops either. I respect the people that play this competitively for learning how to master the controls</review>
      <review>because I sure as hell had a hard time. Getting the ending of the game by clearing a level 9 speed 5 height B game is a total crap shoot due to the RNG of what blocks you get and the arrangement of the garbage blocks</review>

    <summary>Super Mario 3D World is a 3D platformer action game for the Wii U, and a follow-up of the Nintendo 3DS installment Super Mario 3D Land. The game builds upon the previous installment, following a similar 3D level-design convention inspired from the 2D platformer titles where players must navigate through a linear-designed level within a time limit to reach a level's Goal Pole. One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.</summary>

    <summary>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney − Trials and Tribulations (known as Gyakuten Saiaban 3 in Japan) is the third game in the Ace Attorney series. Players take on the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney known for taking on seemingly impossible cases. While the game focuses on a few specific cases, the overarching story of the Phoenix Wright franchise spans the length of the series, involving obscure characters from large families and intricate webs of lies, plots, and murder. The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.</summary>

    <summary>Yume Nikki is a 32-Bit freeware game created by Kikiyama, a Japanese solo game designer. The game was made using RPGMaker 2003. The game is regarded as one of the most original applications of RPGMaker 2003, and the start of a possible new genre of games. "Yume Nikki" means "Dream Diary" in Japanese, and the game follows a young girl named Madotsuki as she dreams. The goal is to seek out and acquire all 24 'Effects'. The game otherwise has no plot, and nearly the entire game is left up to speculation.</summary>

      <review>"Yume Nikki is one of those games I often point to in conversation with fellow designers as a shining example of how well a video game can capture a specific person's experience. These types of RPG Maker horror games usually get a bad rap; they are often cheap products made by inexperienced designers who believe that mashing teenage girl protagonists with horrific set pieces will instantly make a work profound. Yume Nikki does not deserve to be lumped in with the contemporaries. Kikiyama</review>
      <review>the developer</review>
      <review>managed to extract clever narrative meaning within the bounds of RPG Maker's limited toolset in a way that left me genuinely floored. This game is best approached completely blind</review>

      <review>"Max Payne is such a good game with some crippling problems that really date it. The voice acting is top tier</review>
      <review>and James McCaffrey is the biggest reason for this success and is one of the best voice actors ever. The gameplay is unqiue and so satisfying</review>

      <review>and the game's crippling issues with the difficulty slider got annoying really quick. Walking through a door and getting insta-headshot three times and then the fourth time doing the same thing and not having it happen got annoying</review>
      <review>and supposedly there is a major bug that makes it so the difficulty slider</review>
      <review>which is tied to the only difficulty you can play at the start</review>
      <review>is broken and doesn't properly balance the game. As well</review>
      <review>some aspects feel a little too gamey in this serious tale</review>
      <review>with a few levels sticking out like a sore thumb (the underground level). I feel enemy variety wasn't really a thing</review>
      <review>just the same enemy that got stronger and stronger. But overall</review>
      <review>this is a very good game with aspects that haven't ever really been replicated as well</review>

    <summary>Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?</summary>

But though madmen and tyrants fall to his blade, never will he claim that his battle is right. For the tsurugi he wields is cursed Muramasa, which five centuries ago brought ruin to the land, and innocent blood is the price it demands in exchange for its terrible might.

    <summary>Mario Kart 64 is the second main installment of the Mario Kart series. It is the first game in the series to use three-dimensional graphics, however, the characters and items in this game are still two-dimensional, pre-rendered sprites. The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.</summary>

Greece during the Peloponnesian War was a dream setting for an Assassin's Creed game that I had been asking for back when I was a big fan of the series.

      <review>which I now realise was from a lot of AC fans feeling spurned by the new direction. Despite enjoying Origins</review>
      <review>I wasn't chomping at the bit to play an iterative sequel. So yes</review>
      <review>that's why I waited so long but I'm glad I've played it now since I adore it. Origins was mostly an action adventure game with some RPG mechanics which incidentally describes most games these days. Ultimately</review>

You must navigate through the hostile game world with limited resources, this requires to use your wits to survive and correctly manage your resources as you encounters various terrors and dangers throughout the game. The environments may also change without warning in real-time based on your actions, adding more variables to the game.</summary>

      <review>['Tries to capture the same magic that RE4 has but doesn’t have as interesting combat or characters.'</review>
      <review>"awesome gameplay. traversing and fighting your way through the nightmarish setpieces is super cool and enjoyable. every weapon you get has its purpose and i found myself using all of them</review>
      <review>which i can appreciate a lot as it adds variety. my big criticism is that the story is just okay</review>
      <review>the characters are uninteresting</review>
      <review>and the dialogue/writing is quite frankly bad. the characters' reactions are so tame compared to the dire situations they're in</review>
      <review>and rarely do they emote with any intensity. their lives are constantly in danger but they sure don't act like it. the gameplay and environments are genuinely great enough to warrant 4 stars."</review>
      <review>'Action games generally operate on the concept of player empowerment</review>
      <review>granting the tools to overcome any challenge without a scratch</review>
      <review>as long as players have the skill to realize that potential. Meanwhile</review>
      <review>horror games operate on the concept of player\n \n disempowerment\n \n</review>
      <review>giving the bare minimum in order to foster a tense atmosphere</review>
      <review>so balancing the priorities of each genre seems like mixing oil and water. Resident Evil games are famous for trying to do so</review>
      <review>but they usually break into a horror-centric first half and an action-centric back half</review>
      <review>without a true blending of the concepts. The Evil Within meanwhile actually managed it</review>
      <review>but had to alienate players in some key ways in order to do so. Firstly</review>
      <review>the logic behind the story is nearly impossible to follow at first</review>
      <review>leaving players unable to find their footing</review>
      <review>confused at why the progression is so jumpy and unfocused. Then</review>
      <review>the mechanical restrictions feel like they’re equally arbitrary: Sebastian can only initially carry about twelve bullets</review>
      <review>and not even a full healthbar’s worth of recovery. He can barely run at all</review>
      <review>and in order to alleviate any of this</review>
      <review>you may have to bank up green gel over the course of multiple chapters. It can seem like the game is simply trying to make action feel scary by stressing out players with cheap deaths</review>
      <review>but once you commit to learning the game</review>
      <review>a brilliant method behind the madness reveals itself. While the story\n \n is\n \n mostly nonsense</review>
      <review>the abstract nature of it allows for level design suited to a wide variety of challenges. With new mechanics being introduced at a steady pace</review>
      <review>players are constantly kept on the backfoot</review>
      <review>and thus disempowered</review>
      <review>even as their growing mechanical knowledge empowers them. The shallow capacity for supplies is an obvious form of disempowerment which prompts players to spend resources cleverly</review>
      <review>but their abundance between each fight empowers players to use their entire toolkit freely. The upgrade system empowers; the below-par baselines make unupgraded stats more of a problem in the face of scaling challenge. For every give</review>
      <review>there’s a take</review>
      <review>and thus</review>
      <review>a harmony between action and horror is reached. As stated before though</review>
      <review>the “take” for that brilliance is a frontloaded sense of disempowerment</review>
      <review>with players having to get through most of the game before they’ve experienced enough character growth and skill development to redress the balance. So</review>
      <review>I really can’t blame anyone for bouncing off of this game</review>
      <review>but I also truly believe that as of today (less than a week away from RE4 remake)</review>
      <review>it’s the best merging of action and horror in gaming. Resident Evil 4 is pure satisfying action</review>
      <review>Dead Space commits to bloody horror</review>
      <review>but The Evil Within is purely… both.'</review>

      <review>'Imagine o que aconteceria se você misturasse a temática</review>
      <review>visual e sanguinolência de Doom com as clássicas mecânicas de jogos rítmicos baseadas em apertar botões no tempo certo. Bom</review>
      <review>essa mistura existe</review>
      <review>e se chama Metal: Hellsinger. Se você já jogou Doom alguma vez na sua vida</review>
      <review>provavelmente já reparou que um dos pontos fortes da saga são suas trilhas sonoras marcantes que conseguem tornar a experiência de cortar demônios ainda mais prazerosa.\n \n Pensando nisso</review>
      <review>a desenvolvedora The Outsiders resolveu criar sua própria versão do clássico de 1993</review>
      <review>porém com a adição de uma mecânica um pouco diferente. Ritmo. A gameplay de Metal: Hellsinger se baseia em realizar as ações tradicionais de um jogo de tiro (Atirar</review>
      <review>pular</review>
      <review>esquivar</review>
      <review>recarregar) porém tudo sincronizado com a música.\n \n No centro da tela ao lado da mira do jogador</review>
      <review>existe um marcador com o BPM da música</review>
      <review>o objetivo é realizar as ações do jogo dentro do tempo. Quanto mais preciso você atira</review>
      <review>mais dano e pontos você faz. Uma das partes que eu mais achei interessante no jogo</review>
      <review>é seu objetivo</review>
      <review>aqui</review>
      <review>seu objetivo não é só completar a fase</review>
      <review>mas também</review>
      <review>fazer a maior pontuação possível.\n \n Ao todo o jogo possui 10 capítulos</review>
      <review>cada capítulo termina com uma Boss Fight e ao completá-lo</review>
      <review>outros 3 desafios são liberados no mesmo cenário. Em questão de tempo de gameplay</review>
      <review>o jogo é relativamente curto podendo ser fechado em cerca de 5 horas</review>
      <review>porém esse tempo pode se estender caso você esteja em busca do 100%.\n \n A história do jogo é simples</review>
      <review>porém o suficiente para um bom plano de fundo de um tiroteio infernal. Você joga como a Desconhecida. Metade humana</review>
      <review>metade demônio</review>
      <review>a Desconhecida parte através do inferno para recuperar sua voz que foi roubada pela Juíza Vermelha. Em sua jornada você deve destruir hordas de demônios e seus líderes para enfim travar um combate com a Juíza e recuperar a voz que lhe foi roubada.\n \n Mas vamos falar do que interessa</review>
      <review>a trilha sonora. A música é o ponto alto do jogo</review>
      <review>e como é de se esperar</review>
      <review>ela é impecavel. O jogo conta com 15 músicas autorais escritas e compostas exclusivamente para o título. A melhor parte é que cada música conta com a participação especial de grandes nomes do metal internacional. Entre os artistas convidados estão Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy)</review>
      <review>Mikael Stanne (Dark Tranquility)</review>
      <review>Tatiana Shmayluk (Jinjer)</review>
      <review>Serj Tankian (System of a Down)</review>
      <review>além de outros grandes nomes</review>
      <review>totalizando 9 artistas convidados.\n \n As músicas são muito boas e qualquer um terá uma experiência agradável jogando</review>
      <review>porém é claro</review>
      <review>elas se tornam muito mais prazerosas para aqueles que não só já gostam do gênero</review>
      <review>mas também para aqueles que já escutavam os artistas convidados previamente.\n \n Os pontos altos do jogo obviamente são focados na música e no gameplay. A trilha sonora acompanha perfeitamente o tiroteio frenético da jornada através do inferno</review>
      <review>e a experiência se torna mais prazerosa com o sistema de ritmo fazendo com que você tenha que acertar tiros</review>
      <review>esquivas e recargas no tempo da música. Também é bom citar como ponto positivo o fato dele estar disponível gratuitamente no Xbox Game Pass.\n \n Não tem muitos pontos negativos no jogo</review>
      <review>mas se for pra citar algum</review>
      <review>talvez seja interessante citar o tempo de gameplay</review>
      <review>que em uma zerada apenas pode ser muito curto e não compensar os R$99 reais investidos. Claro</review>
      <review>esse tempo pode aumentar caso você jogue em uma dificuldade mais elevada</review>
      <review>ou caso você deseje fazer 100% do jogo.'</review>

Two player characters (one male and one female) travel a new region, Unova, on their Pokémon journeys. This region is inhabited by various Pokémon, and unlike before, none of those available prior to Generation V can be obtained before completing the main story by defeating Team Plasma. The games' names were revealed on the official Japanese Pokémon website on April 9, 2010, and scans from the subsequent issue of the magazine leaked the following day, April 10. Pokémon Black and White are followed in 2012 by two sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, which are set two years after the events of Black and White.

    <summary>Hell is an experiment you can't survive in Outlast, a first-person survival horror game developed by veterans of some of the biggest game franchises in history.

      <review>["(Played before 2023)\n \n This is probably the best non-combat horror game I've played</review>
      <review>but I really hate non-combat horror games because it takes away a lot of choices you can make which makes it scarier. To me</review>
      <review>it isn't that scary gameplay-wise when my only option is to run down a hallway and hide in a locker or a bed. The asylum is a cliche but fun setting</review>
      <review>but I'm not that impressed with the game like a lot of other peple are. I think it just came out at a good time where most of thse type of games (and still now) were cheap</review>

Everyone is being subjected to their worst nightmares every time they go to sleep.

    <summary>In September 2006, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, featuring new scenes and gameplay elements. Like the first re-release, this version would combine English audio with Japanese text and also use the "Sanctuary" theme song instead of "Passion". New cutscenes, however, used Japanese voice acting, as they mostly featured Organization XIII members from Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories who did not yet have English voice actors; these scenes were later re-dubbed into English for the HD 2.5 Remix release.</summary>

      <review>"To many this is the best game out of the entire Kingodm Hearts series</review>
      <review>and to be fair there's a lot going for this game. As with many Square Enix games</review>
      <review>they always deliver when it comes to music &amp; overall aesthetics</review>
      <review>especially when compared to KH1 &amp; other Final Fantasy titles. The gameplay is greatly improved upon over Kingdom Hearts 1 in almost every regard: camera</review>
      <review>movement</review>
      <review>combat</review>
      <review>platforming; everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed. With that being said</review>
      <review>this is where the story begins to take a nosedive in every direction. I personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay</review>
      <review>which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the Roxas portion of the game. Without skipping cutscenes</review>
      <review>it's going to take a long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable."</review>
      <review>"In my review of KH1 I remarked on how if I played these games as a kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites</review>
      <review>mostly due to how the game had a sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was a Disney title. This game felt like it had a better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes Disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime-ass vibes that Square Enix was known for. Combined</review>
      <review>those two elements make for a game that I feel if I had played as a kid</review>
      <review>it would have changed things the same way Sonic Adventure 2 did for me. That right there is a powerful energy that I can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone. Unfortunately</review>
      <review>I played this a little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally</review>
      <review>but I absolutely recognize that power when I see it. The game pretty much improves upon the first in every way</review>

      <review>fancier and flashier gameplay</review>
      <review>a more intricate plot</review>
      <review>the whole nine yards. My only major gripe that I have with it is I think the second half could have been streamlined a bit better</review>
      <review>and they could have made both acts for each world happen in a row rather than having you go through every world twice. Outside of that</review>
      <review>this is a particularly special game. Which is certainly something I never thought I'd say about a mfin game where a bunch of edgy cloaked dudes and mickey mouse share the same screen space."</review>

      <review>'I remember back when this was a concept video</review>
      <review>and was super intrigued by the gameplay mechanics. I\'m glad that the game actually found a final version</review>
      <review>and wasn\'t just a concept with nothing done with it! As for the actual game itself</review>
      <review>it was neat. I liked how they focused a lot on perspective based puzzles not only with the main gimmick of resizing objects based on perspective</review>
      <review>but also with things like lighting and making 2D objects 3D</review>
      <review>and resizing yourself to solve puzzles. However</review>
      <review>there definitely were a lot of points where you are just walking through hallways</review>
      <review>which felt like padding. It seems like while the game concept was really cool</review>
      <review>there really wasn\'t a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game "the next portal" like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off. That being said</review>
      <review>Portal is a really high bar</review>
      <review>so not reaching that expectation does not a bad game make</review>
      <review>since this game is still definitely worth playing IMO. The story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics</review>
      <review>which was cool. All in all</review>
      <review>it didn\'t disappoint and I would recommend giving it a play!'</review>
      <review>'Up there with the Portal Series as one of the best puzzle games for me. I\'m not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one "thing" like portals or in this case</review>
      <review>perspective</review>
      <review>means that it\'s not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do. Each puzzle is really cool obviously</review>
      <review>the use of perspective to fiddle with objects is trippy and fun to just mess with. My personal favorite part of the game was the level design and the way it made you feel like you were spiraling ever deeper in a dream. From the endlessly carpeted halls of a hotel to spooky dimly lit backrooms I was on the edge of my seat on this ride. At the very climax of the game</review>
      <review>when you have been spiraling ever deeper trapped in this dream</review>
      <review>the entire thing is kind of thrown away. While the ending still works (avoiding too much for spoilers) it was a bit of a punch in the gut to go from OH MY GOD IM DYING to its all good its the end :). Still I think this game is one of my favorites and everyone should play it.'</review>

      <review>"The Persona series</review>
      <review>along with its parent series Shin Megami Tensai</review>
      <review>have generally been consistent with their themes throughout the years. The collective unconscious</review>
      <review>the masks that people wear to conceal their true selves</review>
      <review>and references to ancient Greek and Japanese mythology are all motifs that are usually present in SMT and Persona games. This has led to a consistently murky tone throughout the series</review>
      <review>in the undertones when not overtly. While the darkest game in the series is up for debate</review>
      <review>there's no debating which is the brightest: Persona 4. Released just 2 years after the decidedly grim Persona 3</review>
      <review>and on the same engine</review>
      <review>P4 delivers an overall joyful and optimistic tone that helped it stand out not only from its predecessor</review>
      <review>but from previous Persona and SMT games as well. This may seem counter-intuitive</review>
      <review>as the focus of the story is on finding a murder suspect who kills 2 people within hours of the game's beginning. Yet it's the moment-to-moment dialogue</review>
      <review>the soundtrack</review>
      <review>even the color palette (the yellow theme provides an overall sunny disposition) that makes Persona 4 not only a joyful experience</review>
      <review>but a joy to experience."]</review>

Players must defeat their opponents multiple times in a fighting frenzy of items and power-ups. Super Smash Bros. is a departure from the general genre of fighting games: instead of depleting an opponent's life bar, the players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken.</summary>

    <summary>Halo 4 marks the start of an epic new saga within the award-winning Halo universe. The Master Chief returns in this award-winning first-person shooter developed by 343 Industries. Shipwrecked on a mysterious world, faced with new enemies and deadly technology, the Chief returns to battle against an ancient evil bent on vengeance and annihilation...the universe will never be the same.</summary>

    <summary>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a open world third-person action role-playing video game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium. The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life. The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor. The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier. A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.</summary>

      <review>much better stage design</review>
      <review>iconic boss fights that provide decent challenge</review>
      <review>more variety in the obtainable powers and improved difficulty balancing alongside another incredible banger of a soundtrack. I can totally see why this game gets the (well-deserved) praise that it gets. A legitimately fun game that I could totally see myself playing more in the future whereas I never want to touch the first Mega Man ever again.'</review>
      <review>'Without a single doubt superior to the first game</review>
      <review>this is the true seminal episode. Includes everything that other Mega Man games will do. Level design is great</review>
      <review>challenge is present</review>

      <review>in spite of NES limitations. Secondly</review>
      <review>the soundtrack is phenomenal</review>

      <review>I mentioned that it was a contender for one of the best NES games and holds up in modern times.\n \n Mega Man 2\n \n was the most poignant example in my mind that stopped me from definitively saying “the best”'</review>
      <review>'way better level design and difficulty than 1. the robot masters are iconic</review>
      <review>it has some super banging music</review>
      <review>and the weapons are overall an improvement in usability and variety. truly a classic and one of the downright coolest mega man games'</review>
      <review>"Mega Man 2 is an NES game where nowadays you can actually finish the game on a first playthrough without using save states or banging your head on a wall due to how difficult it is. MegaMan 2 is a very balanced game with very good platforming and levels. It fixes the issues of Mega Man 1</review>
      <review>which aren't many aside from NOT being janky and difficult as the 1st game. This is officially one of my favorite NES games and I heavily recommend playing it if you want to get into the Mega Man franchise"</review>
      <review>"If you are familiar with the Mega Man series</review>
      <review>or NES games in general</review>
      <review>you would know that this is without a doubt the most popular and beloved game in the entire franchise</review>

      <review>it is a fantastic improvement from the previous</review>

      <review>"One of the first games that I was given for my PlayStation 4 was a physical copy of\n \n Infamous: Second Son\n \n</review>
      <review>but because my console's disc drive got clogged up with dust at one point</review>
      <review>I wasn't able to play it (or any other physical PS4 game</review>
      <review>for that matter) for years. Now that I finally got that fixed</review>
      <review>I started playing through this game shortly after beating\n \n Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\n \n</review>
      <review>and while I wouldn't consider this to be a terrible game</review>
      <review>I wouldn't exactly say that I liked it.\n \n Infamous: Second Son\n \n is one of the most aggressively milquetoast games I've ever played</review>
      <review>as almost everything about it feels designed to be just competent enough to keep the player from switching the game off without actually being all that noteworthy. The generic visual style and music really didn't help with this</review>
      <review>as it just made the game generally feel much more bland and flavorless. Like a lot of these kinds of games</review>
      <review>\n \n Infamous: Second Son\n \n focuses on the player having to fight yet another force of tyranny</review>
      <review>and every plot point and character relationship within that journey is as predictable as they can be. None of the characters were very interesting</review>
      <review>but my least favorite was easily the protagonist</review>
      <review>because on top of the obviously bad idea of making him be part of a fictional Native American tribe</review>
      <review>Delsin Rowe was also just annoying</review>
      <review>as his constant quips and one-liners consistently got on my nerves."</review>
      <review>"This game is what validated my PS4 back when it came out. Visually it still looks great with a lot of good lighting and particle effects. Either that or I'm still just easy to please. The plot is pretty cool too</review>
      <review>as you play as some rebel dude tryin to overthrow the authority with his elemental powers. As your character can steal elemental powers from other people</review>
      <review>there's a lot of different abilities you can use and can switch from element to element on the fly so that's cool. There are also moments where you hold the dualshock 4 controller sideways like a spray can to paint stuff and that goes hard I love dumb controller gimmicks. I had a good time with this one."</review>
      <review>'Any game with a protagonist that can shoot stuff out of his hands and is voiced by Troy Baker is getting a good score from me. The karma system isn’t used as good as in the originals</review>
      <review>but this game still looks and plays fantastic.'</review>

      <review>'It\'s not that great.\n \n I don\'t see anyone explaining why exactly they like this game so much but I can only guess because others don\'t intend on making a long analysis on a Kirby game</review>
      <review>or they are biased by nostalgia. I beat this edition and played through most of the original as a kid</review>
      <review>and I can say I never had strong memories about it aside from a few rooms. Beating it now after coming from other Kirby games</review>
      <review>the game is plainly dated and I found myself rushing to just beat it after a while.\n \n The presentation is cute</review>
      <review>the hybrid artstyle and cutscenes are nice to see</review>
      <review>but as far as gameplay goes</review>
      <review>SSU doesn\'t do too much to add from the original — which I definitely have qualms over.\n \n Air movement is very sad in this game. Previous entries weren\'t that great in this either</review>
      <review>but it feels extremely noticable here. Jumps are not as pronounced (wheel still did not have this at the time</review>
      <review>but felt like it could\'ve been included)</review>
      <review>flying (a major trait of Kirby) feels like such a pain in the ass that it\'s better to avoid it over ground movement where possible</review>
      <review>and many of the levels contain claustrophobic designs</review>
      <review>sometimes cram-packed with enemies on top of hazard spam (either with lava or electricity as the main suspects) which all started to blur into one another instead of giving each place an overly distinct identity (aside from stages that were a 1-off gimmick). The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding</review>
      <review>which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds</review>
      <review>killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS</review>
      <review>but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design. One-gap holes you must fall into</review>
      <review>mazes galore and some other unintuitive puzzles (specific lava being passable when the rest isn\'t) drowned my joy out.\n \n I don\'t have much to say about the rest</review>
      <review>everyone loves Marx and Galacta Knight. Meta Knightmare felt the most fun to play and control with the energy system being cool enough</review>
      <review>but I don\'t care too much about the "minigame" direction chosen. I personally prefer a centralized thing</review>
      <review>and each segment didn\'t make me feel like replaying it. I understand why they went this route</review>
      <review>though.\n \n There is no bad Kirby game</review>
      <review>and if managed to 97% the game then it was partially fun enough</review>
      <review>but I have to give it my personal "OK" rating that made it a bit below Squeak Squad. Other games have more to offer and feel better to play</review>
      <review>and all the "hip and cool" concepts of this game are mostly at the end of one\'s playthrough to postpone playing it (if you\'re not playing Kirbies in order). An alright game to spend an afternoon on.'</review>
      <review>'They really took the best kirby game and made it even better. Everything that made the original game great is enhanced here</review>
      <review>in addition to this game having several brand new modes after Milky Way Wishes. This game is the origin of a lot of modern kirby mainstays like Masked Dedede and Galacta Knight. Clearing the true arena in this game was a massive accomplishment for anyone in my friend group who could survive the final 4 gauntlet. Lots of good memories with this game both playing it back then and going back to it now. Truly the pinnacle of the series.']</review>

    <summary>The King of All Cosmos accidentally destroyed the stars and—having recovered—wants the prince to rebuild them. Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King. Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items. Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions. The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.</summary>

      <review>it's literally picking up objects. As you increase in size</review>
      <review>so do your pickups. Racing against a time-limit is somehow relaxing just sucking up the world with ease."</review>
      <review>"I don't have much to say about this game that hasn't been repeated for the past almost 20 years. It's easily one of the best titles on the PS2. Maybe one of the greatest games ever made! The visuals make me laugh and the music makes me cry. The simple concept is just so much fun to play with."</review>
      <review>"honestly one of the textbook examples of what video games can be. Aesthetically incredible</review>

      <review>as your ball starts small</review>
      <review>and you need to roll things up to be bigger. The runtime is a perfect length where it neither over nor understays its welcome</review>

    <summary>The world is in peril as forces, both good and evil, make a play for the powerful Chaos Emeralds. In Shadow the Hedgehog, you can control Shadow and choose which side to fight for. This 3D platformer lets you use weapons, vehicles, environmental objects, and time and space manipulation to combat your foes. Although it is a 3D platform game as with the more recent Sonic Adventure games, the game's levels each feature up to three different missions (Hero, Dark, Normal) that the player may choose to complete. The game's plot depends on which mission is completed as well as subsequent playable levels. The game stars Shadow the Hedgehog and his quest to recover his memory, a goal he has been pursuing since his debut in Sonic Adventure 2, while an evil alien race known as the Black Arms is invading the planet.</summary>

      <review>and the remake makes the areas of the game feel circular in design. The boss fights are way too tanky and some feel like they drag on forever. My final complaint is regard to Ridley's surprise appearance as the final boss. I love Ridley as much as the next guy</review>
      <review>but Ridley's sudden appearance doesn't really fit the tone and atmosphere of the game. It's a cool and fun boss fight</review>

      <review>I don't like the game as much as I thought I did. Pandora is seen as a boring desert with nothing interesting</review>
      <review>the psychos were cool but the only unique enemies (outside of the DLC). Guns were okay but not nearly as unique in sequels</review>
      <review>and the characters just... Weren't interesting? I think the ones you play as are cool but their skill trees are awfully simply and that makes them feel pretty boring until you get to max level which requires three playthroughs. Yay. I think the sequels are a lot better."</review>

    <summary>Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is a side-scrolling platform game viewed from a "2.5D" perspective. The player moves the protagonist, Klonoa, along a path in a two-dimensional fashion, but the game is rendered in three dimensions. This allows the path followed to curve and for the player to interact with objects outside of the path.</summary>

      <review>['Did this inspire The Empty Man??'</review>
      <review>"This game was a genuinely just</review>
      <review>great experience. The platforming segments are great</review>
      <review>and for the most part are really well designed</review>
      <review>though some areas not so much. I love the 2.5D style</review>
      <review>and how the levels bend and intersect</review>
      <review>it creates quite a unique aesthetic that I love.\n \n The game overall</review>
      <review>while challenging at times</review>
      <review>very rarely gets annoying or frustrating</review>
      <review>which I'm very happy with. And honestly</review>
      <review>I'd say a solid 70ish percent of the game I had no difficulty at all. I found some of the late game bosses to be some of my favorite parts of the entire game. I really love the puzzles as well</review>
      <review>yet again they're really well designed.\n \n I think the only issue I had</review>
      <review>and this isn't even necessarily an issue with the game</review>
      <review>is that I had bad depth perception</review>
      <review>so sometimes I can't really tell how far away a thing is</review>
      <review>if it's not on the same plane as Klonoa. But aside from that</review>
      <review>this game was an absolute blast to play</review>
      <review>and its ending is definitely worth it."</review>
      <review>"A mountain of classic 90s J-charm smooths over some minor flaws in the moment-to-moment platforming. In the tradition of all the best side-scrollers</review>
      <review>your set of abilities is narrow but they are perfectly defined</review>
      <review>taught</review>
      <review>and explored to their limits by game's end. Also manages to be forgiving without being 'easy'. Good stuff!"</review>
      <review>"I know this game has a lot of reviews already on this site but this was a very great game so why not. Klonoa has always one of those series I've been meaning to try more of. But before I talk about the game</review>
      <review>thought I'd share my history with the series."</review>

    <summary>From the critically acclaimed developer, Naughty Dog, comes the first standalone adventure in the Uncharted series. Fan-favorite character, Chloe Frazer, must enlist the aid of renowned mercenary Nadine Ross from Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End in order to recover a fabled ancient Indian artifact and keep it out of the hands of a ruthless war profiteer. Together, they’ll venture deep into the mountains of India in search of the legendary artifact. Along the way, they’ll learn to work together to unearth the mystery of the artifact, fight their way through fierce opposition, and prevent the region from falling into chaos.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["I was worried that the retirement of Nathan would leave Uncharted without anything to carry a story</review>
      <review>as I never considered Chloe a very interesting character in 2. Thankfully</review>
      <review>Lost Legacy compensates nicely with a shorter story</review>
      <review>that doesn't ask too much of the player while still hitting all the correct beats. The gameplay improvements made in 4 make a triumphant return</review>
      <review>though the climbing is still annoying. Each big set-piece is dynamic and exciting</review>
      <review>the game never lingers too long or moves on too quickly. On the open-zone section in the beginning I have conflicted feelings. On one hand</review>
      <review>the dialouge between Chloe and Nadine is charming and entertaining without feeling too artificial</review>
      <review>and I enjoyed the scenery. However</review>
      <review>this series has always been about maintaining momentum. I now have a newfound appreciation for the sublime pacing of the older games</review>
      <review>after experiencing what it feels like to lose that forward-moving feeling. The game definietly picks up the tempo again afterwards</review>
      <review>but I can't say the section left a good impression overall. The rest of the game is exactly as one would expect. The villain is nothing special</review>
      <review>the platforming is cool and rhytmic</review>
      <review>but not very complex</review>
      <review>and there aren't really any themes to delve into beyond the absolute minimum stuff. I don't mind though</review>
      <review>I am satisfied with the game being a nice adventure to relax with</review>
      <review>a role it easily fulfills."</review>
      <review>'The final Uncharted game (for now atleast) and its....fine.'</review>
      <review>'Bom'</review>
      <review>'A dlc do melhor jogo já feito</review>
      <review>logo</review>
      <review>a melhor dlc já feita.'</review>
      <review>'Fun game</review>
      <review>but generic as generic can possibly be. Amy Hennig as a writer was the soul of this franchise and without her Uncharted became stale. Neil Druckmann gives you a modest american movie</review>
      <review>but as a videogame he gives the most generic story possible and fails to write Chloe as a charismatic protagonist - he transformed her in another Nathan Drake -. Every action scene is copied from another Uncharted game and the structure add nothing to mechanics and functionality. The villain is bland and the male characters are there to fill the misandry quota. All the merits of this game still belongs to Uncharted 1</review>
      <review>2 and 3. Play only if you want a little movie experience</review>
      <review>or watch the cutscenes on YouTube.'</review>
      <review>'Everyone told me that Uncharted was a videogame franchise with no bad games</review>
      <review>well what do you call this garbage then? The Story is that Chloe hires Nadine (from the fourth game) to help her retrieve a ancient Indian artifact</review>
      <review>this is an odd idea for a story</review>
      <review>because Chloe knows about Nadine\'s history with her friends Nathan and Sam Drake</review>
      <review>yet she works with someone who hates them</review>
      <review>and doesn\'t think she will turn on her</review>
      <review>and when she finds out that Sam was helping out</review>
      <review>Nadine feels betrayed</review>
      <review>assaults Chloe</review>
      <review>and abandons her</review>
      <review>until she apologizes</review>
      <review>but Nadine says that she is now only helping Chloe out for the treasure</review>
      <review>but don\'t worry</review>
      <review>she gets over it randomly after they help a trapped elephant</review>
      <review>it happens so fast that there isn\'t even a moment where Nadine is completely over it</review>
      <review>she randomly is</review>
      <review>and they both act like it never happened</review>
      <review>because the writing is terrible</review>
      <review>when it comes to the character moments</review>
      <review>and after they are trapped with Sam</review>
      <review>him and Nadine both argue a lot</review>
      <review>because of their history</review>
      <review>but when interacting</review>
      <review>Chloe trusts the girl who assaulted her and tried to kill her former lover</review>
      <review>and his brother</review>
      <review>more than she trusts her former lover\'s brother</review>
      <review>which feels like Feminism</review>
      <review>where the two girls get along</review>
      <review>where as the man is played for a foil to it</review>
      <review>which is frowned upon in this</review>
      <review>and since Nadine never shows any remorse for what she did in the last game to the protagonist</review>
      <review>and Sam does</review>
      <review>it makes Nadine even less likeable than she already was</review>
      <review>and ruins the story completely</review>
      <review>and studios need to stop this garbage. The Characters are no where near as good as their last previous appearances</review>
      <review>thanks to Chloe being sympathetic to a former villain over a man</review>
      <review>Nadine worsened by trying to make us like her</review>
      <review>by being an unlikeable villain to hero tale</review>
      <review>without even regretting her actions</review>
      <review>and made Sam to feel more of a nuisance than a main character</review>
      <review>to the point where he doesn\'t even bring his own grapple hook (even though he would never do that)</review>
      <review>stop writing feminism over male\'s feelings in games</review>
      <review>and shame the people who think otherwise</review>
      <review>the villain is barely anymore interesting than the first game\'s main villain</review>
      <review>with his history with an old kingdom</review>
      <review>but it doesn\'t go beyond that</review>
      <review>and I enjoyed the traits of the second game\'s main villain more. The Graphics are as good as the remastered versions of the first 3 games</review>
      <review>with some moments are awe (the best being when you run off a train heading off a broken bridge</review>
      <review>even if the second game\'s train scene was much better)</review>
      <review>but no where near as good as the fourth game</review>
      <review>and not as many memorable moments to be on par with games 2 and 3</review>
      <review>they have better looking events than the first game though. The Gameplay is the same as before</review>
      <review>only shorter to the point where it\'s less than half the length of games 2</review>
      <review>3</review>
      <review>and 4</review>
      <review>and in chapter 4</review>
      <review>you can optionally find coins to retrieve a ruby bracelet</review>
      <review>but no other moments like it make it feel random</review>
      <review>silenced pistols were a great addition</review>
      <review>but chapters 5</review>
      <review>and especially 4 feel far too long</review>
      <review>and could have been shortened</review>
      <review>to make 2 more chapters</review>
      <review>especially with how big you have to travel for completing chapter 4 is. The Music is not as memorable as before due to less moments to have them takeover the scene for atmosphere</review>
      <review>and the song at the end "Borders</review>
      <review>by M.I.A" is a bland and forgettable song. Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</review>
      <review>brought back the Uncharted franchise to consoles</review>
      <review>and made me wish that it had stayed lost.']</review>

    <summary>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a survival horror video game and the third installment in the Resident Evil series. Like its two predecessors, it is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, the gameplay is improved by features such as auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows Jill to avoid enemy attacks. The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.</summary>

      <review>["no self imposed challenges or other foolishness with this one for me. i've always been a bit of a flop with this one (3 has been the hardest of the original trilogy for me by a large margin) so i just went for an A rank."</review>
      <review>"(Played before 2023)\n \n This was my first Resident Evil Experience. I was probably five or six years old</review>
      <review>at a friends house. I remember booting the game on easy</review>
      <review>shooting the first zombie or two with the assault riflt</review>
      <review>and being so scared that I couldn't play it. A few years later I actually beat it and I enjoyed it but not as much as the second. The dodge was cool but way too frustrating to use</review>
      <review>and while I loved exploring the city I think that the second half isn't as strong because it is basically the same thing as the other two games. Sewers and Lab. I also didn't really like Carlos too much honestly and found him annoying</review>
      <review>and I was also missing the city in chaos part. You don't really see civilians surviving at all</review>
      <review>which was a little detail I liked in the remake. I also felt the game didn't feel as replayable even with the zap system</review>
      <review>which is a big focus of the series."</review>
      <review>'Obrigado capcom por essa masterpiece'</review>
      <review>"man like i wanted to like this just as much as 1 and 2 but there are a CRAPTON of bad level design and enemy placement choices</review>
      <review>making this ultimately the most inferior out of the classic trilogy. levels are cramped and theres a lot of times where you will get ambush sniped by an offscreen zombie hiding behind a corner</review>
      <review>or just zombies in one-person-wide corridors where you better hope you have the ammo to take them out otherwise you aren't getting through. Nemesis is cool though</review>
      <review>I like the funny zombie guy. I wish he showed up more frequently and stalked you all throughout the map</review>
      <review>but the times he does show up can be exciting</review>
      <review>and the man runs at you like a football player which is awesome. All in all</review>
      <review>the game is definitely memorable and worth checking out if you like resident evil stuff</review>
      <review>but it is definitely the most flawed and occasionally frustrating game of the classic style</review>
      <review>so beware."</review>

      <review>com maior desenvolvimento que os anteriores.'</review>

    <summary>F.E.A.R. is a horror FPS that resembles a cross between Doom 3, Half-Life, and the Ring horror movies. Demons are replaced by cloned soldiers and the element of horror revolves around an image of a spectral girl always appearing when least expected for a few fleeting moments. The player sets out as a member of a specialized strike force dealing with unknown threats. Initially, the player starts with mundane weapons, which are well presented, and progress gradually towards more sci-fi ones as the danger increases. The player can also call upon a bullet-time ability which slows down time around the player and is realised with impressive visual and aural effects by the game engine.</summary>

      <review>but I didn’t have much incentive to go after them. The 1930’s aesthetic is beautiful and driving around is super fun with the more realistic handling compared to GTA.

    <summary>Similar to the previous season, The Walking Dead: Season Two is a point-and-click adventure game. The player, in control of Clementine, can direct the character around the environment, examine and interact with various scenery elements and collect and use objects to advance the story. The player can also initiate conversations with non-player characters via conversation trees. Certain replies from other characters may offer the player multiple choices to select from, including the option to stay silent, with a limited amount of time to make the selection; if the player does not select an option, the conversation will continue as if they had stayed quiet. Such choices can affect how the other characters will later react to Clementine which can influence later events in the story. Other scenes are more action-oriented, requiring the player to complete quick time events to avoid Clementine or her allies from getting killed. If the player fails these events, the game will restart at the start of such scenes. Such action scenes may also require the player to make a key decision within a limited time frame, such as which of two characters to save from attacking walkers.</summary>

    <summary>Max Payne 2 is a third-person shooter, in which the player assumes the role of Max Payne, but also plays as Mona Sax in a few levels. Initially, the player's weapon is a 9mm pistol. As they progress, players access other weapons including other handguns, shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and hand-thrown weapons. To move the game along, the player is told what the next objective is through Max's internal monologue, in which Max iterates what his next steps should be.</summary>

    <summary>Pac-Man is an arcade game developed by Namco and first released in Japan on May 22, 1980. it is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets or just dots). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.</summary>

      <review>big dot means you can eat ghost. The concept is addicting but I believe the true reason why this game popped off hard was due to its character. No longer were you shooting aliens in a generic spaceship</review>
      <review>you were a character with a name getting chased by other characters with names and even their own personalities. I don't know if this was the first game EVER to do such a thing (probably not)</review>
      <review>but it was the first to do it and really explode in popularity. The power dynamic flipping whenever you get a power pellet is also a pretty cartoony mechanic in its own right which makes the game just have this cartoonish charm. There's also very basic cutscenes every couple of levels that give a decent break in the action. Pac man is cool</review>

      <review>['I was feeling pretty frustrated with this game around the endgame and final dungeon</review>
      <review>unfortunately</review>
      <review>and I don’t think it would have been quite as tough to get through in the original PS2 release. I’ll get to those problems later</review>
      <review>but I gotta say</review>
      <review>the banger final boss sequence through the last cutscene really carried it through to me. Final Fantasy X is just a good ass story! Who knew a story about a pro sportsball player getting isekaied into some kinda death cult continent would be so solid?? I am not afraid to admit that I cried several times. Some aspects weren’t total bangers in that regard—I feel like Seymour was handled a little weirdly and Kimhari could’ve used more focus. Also letting the player name Tidus was a\n \n deeply\n \n weird and awkward decision</review>
      <review>and while the actors were doing the best they could with the bizarre voice direction they received</review>
      <review>some of the delivery is a little weird. Fortunately</review>
      <review>it all comes together pretty nicely and I feel like it’s definitely worth experiencing!'</review>

      <review>I'm talking about the one with the guy and his story</review>
      <review>just going to preface with that."</review>
      <review>'final fantasy x is still probably my favorite ff aesthetically. going through and watching the fmv cutscenes was a treat</review>
      <review>and i think they still look really good considering the original release date</review>
      <review>though i dont know how much that can be attributed to the HD-ification. though i have a few problems with the game (the way xp is distributed and its upsetting linearity to name a few)</review>
      <review>i can still safely say its in my top 3 of mainline ff games.'</review>

    <summary>Mortal Kombat X is the tenth main game in the one-on-one fighting series and a sequel to the 2011 title Mortal Kombat. The game stays close to the visual style and the mechanics of the 2011 reboot. The main controls are still based on two types of punches and kicks, and blocking, to form combos with uppercuts, teleports, special moves that incorporate weapons and fatalities. The three-tiered energy from the previous title returns, making available X-Ray moves, powered up EX moves and combo breakers. As introduced in Injustice: Gods Among Us, characters can use the environment to re-position themselves or optionally use parts as weapons. Each character now has three variations with different moves and weapons. There is once again a sprinting gauge, returning from Mortal Kombat 4.</summary>

    <summary>Under the influence of a group of evil Tikis, the animals of Donkey Kong Island have raided Donkey Kong's banana hoard and stolen his stash of bananas - and being an ape of large appetites he understandably wants them back. Good thing that you are along for the ride. With Donkey Kong Country Returns, Retro Studios brings Donkey Kong back to a banana and platforming hungry public in a new side-scrolling adventure with familiar characters and new levels that reignite the passion players had for the Super NES original and all things Donkey Kong.</summary>

The game follows the main protagonist, William Joseph "B.J." Blazkowicz, in his efforts to ignite a Second American Revolution. The game is played from a first-person perspective and most of its levels are navigated on foot. The story is arranged in chapters, which players complete in order to progress. A binary choice in the prologue alters the game's entire storyline; some characters and small plot points are replaced throughout the timelines. The game features a variety of weapons, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is also present.</summary>

      <review>'boring as hell'</review>
      <review>'I remember playing this back when it first released and I bought it from a Redbox back when they still had games for rental. I remember having a beyond frustrating experience with the game’s difficulty and the story feeling like a downgrade. On a replay I actually enjoyed the gameplay much more</review>
      <review>I played it on the hardest difficulty possible and by doing so I think I kinda forced myself to have a more fun time. By having the game throw everything at me all at once I was forced to use the new mechanics that New Colossus added</review>
      <review>and within about 2 hours of gameplay something clicked in my head and I just started having the most fun I’ve had with an FPS in a while. I also really liked how the story matched up with the gameplay with BJs health matching what he’s doing in the story at that point.'</review>

    <summary>PokÃ©mon Diamond Version and Pearl Version are role-playing games (RPGs) developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. With the enhanced remake PokÃ©mon Platinum, the games comprise the fifth installment and fourth generation of the PokÃ©mon series of RPGs. First released in Japan on September 28, 2006, the games were later released to North America, Australia, and Europe over the course of 2007. Like previous PokÃ©mon games, Diamond and Pearl chronicle the adventures of a young PokÃ©mon trainer as he/she trains and battles PokÃ©mon while also thwarting the schemes of a criminal organization. The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and PokÃ©mon Contests, along with addition of 107 new PokÃ©mon. The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them in order to complete the games' PokÃ©dexes.</summary>

    <summary>Marvel Snap: The fastest card battler in the multiverse! Build your Marvel dream team in this fast-paced, action-packed, collectible card game available on Mobile and PC.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["Starts out surprisingly fun and addictive at first with an interesting gambling system to determine rank</review>
      <review>and to its credit</review>
      <review>does a good job at first of hiding how retardedly pay-to-win it is. Then you reach either a high enough rank or high enough collector level and realize if you're not spending $20+ a month</review>
      <review>you're not winning games consistently."</review>
      <review>"Still playing it time to time but</review>
      <review>as every card game</review>
      <review>I got tired. This does not mean that the game is not a blast: it is actually the first card game I've played for so long and with so much enjoyment. Highly recommend"</review>
      <review>"Marvel Snap was the biggest surprise of 2022. I have never been a fan of card game portions of games. Less than 5 hours of my life as Geralt was spent on Gwent</review>
      <review>triple triad in FFXIV does nothing for me and I actively despised Joustus in king of cards. I'm also not a big fan of mobile games as they are typically shallow affairs that never hold my attention. So for Marvel snap to be my most played game to release in 2022 and a near ever-present in my daily life</review>
      <review>they must have got something right. The key to marvel snap is that its easy to pick up and hard to master. Each card is both a part of marvel's illustrious history and a chess piece that can change the game if used correctly. A game of marvel snap lasts less than 5 minutes so it's easy to justify trying different combination of cards as picking cards with poor synergy will not cost you much. The process of developing wining decks is as satisfying as learning the ropes in any fighting game. The games various locations that impact each match only add to the complexity as you alter your strategy based on there affects as well as your opponents moves. The snap is a genius mechanic that forces you to either call there bluff or fold like its a high stake poker game. The ability to upgrade your cards</review>
      <review>so they are 3D holographic brings back childhood memories</review>
      <review>alongside giving the game a engaging gameplay loop. Upgrading your cards</review>
      <review>daily challenges and season challenges keep me coming back day after day. Not being able to buy unique cards is one of the best decisions the devs ever made and allows me to come back day after day unlocking new cards</review>
      <review>getting a holographic card collection my childhood self could only dream of and switching between strategies to keep the game fresh is a wining formula where the marvel licence is only the cherry on top of a delicious cake."</review>
      <review>"A card game with simple mechanics. Easy to get into difficult to master. You'll be surprised how many diverse decks you can come up with</review>
      <review>with ass simple cards this game offers. Each match takes about 2 minutes or so and every match feels unique enough to keep you engaged in its core gameplay loop."</review>
      <review>'Marvel Snap is a bit like Destiny 2</review>
      <review>Apex Legends</review>
      <review>and many others in the “game as a service” category: a great game you probably shouldn’t play.\n \n There is no denying that Marvel Snap is astoundingly great at being a quick and flashy 2-player card battler: card effects are superbly designed</review>
      <review>so that almost every cards feels powerful and great to play; decks are exactly 12 cards</review>
      <review>so it’s easy to deckbuild</review>
      <review>experiment</review>
      <review>and try many different strategies; and</review>
      <review>at exactly 6 turns</review>
      <review>each game is snappy I got used to firing up the matchmaking every time I have to go downstairs to grab a food delivery — and I live in the second story on my building. Win or lose</review>
      <review>you’ll play your cards</review>
      <review>watch their flashy effects</review>
      <review>and have your dopamine hit. It really does feel great.\n \n Not to mention one of the best parts of the design</review>
      <review>the titular snapping mechanic: with one tap</review>
      <review>you can stake your progression with a “double or nothing” gamble. No matter if you’re really confident or just bluffing</review>
      <review>the other player either needs to call it or concede defeat. This creates tension like a motherfucker.\n \n So let me get this straight</review>
      <review>you’re thinking. Snap looks stunning</review>
      <review>is polished to a shine</review>
      <review>and feels genuinely great to play. What’s the problem?\n \n The price.\n \n By 2023</review>
      <review>it’s basically a cliché to say free-to-play games are the most expensive in the market. Everyone knows that. Snap is no different. You will download the game for free</review>
      <review>sure</review>
      <review>but you will pay — if not with money</review>
      <review>than with the bad feeling of playing a lesser game than everyone else</review>
      <review>and having to grind more to be less competitive. You’ll always be behind on the new cards</review>
      <review>and every game you lose will remind you this problema can be solved with your credit card.\n \n Just get it</review>
      <review>you’ll think. It’s just the price of an indie game per month to keep on top of the Season Passes</review>
      <review>you’ll think. It won’t bankrupt me</review>
      <review>you’ll think. I don’t even have time to play a new indie game every month to completion. This game brings me fun consistently. I like Marvel heroes! Pretend it’s a subscription! You’ll think all of these things and others to justify continuously spending time on intangible items that would have been unlockable through gameplay if this was a good old regular paid game as god intended.\n \n And then one day you’ll write a review on Marvel Snap on Letterboxd and</review>
      <review>as you write</review>
      <review>you’ll realize what an idiot you’ve been to think this was okay. And you will decide</review>
      <review>right then and there</review>
      <review>while writing the penultimate paragraph</review>
      <review>to just uninstall Snap and get a new indie game instead.\n \n I think I’ll start with Pizza Tower. Yeah. :) I hear great things</review>
      <review>and it’s even cheaper than a Snap season pass.\n \n Now that feels great.\n \n …\n \n I once heard that the act of writing is in itself the act of thinking</review>
      <review>just a bit slower and more methodical. I can now state with confidence: that tracks.'</review>
      <review>"I played this game every day between October 1 and February 7. The gameplay of Snap is excellent</review>
      <review>and for a while the treadmill is really enticing—I earned new cards at a pace and in an order that successfully sparked some inspiration in the new combos I could try. When that happened</review>
      <review>I could play dozens of games whittling the new deck and strategy down</review>
      <review>until I got something new that did the same thing</review>
      <review>and so on. As deck variety increases so does strategic complexity</review>
      <review>and the game is excellent at getting you time and opportunity to explore its systems; there's not many explicit tutorials</review>
      <review>but the card effects are simple and the at your decks grows feels so natural. It must be said the card game itself feels really well-designed and balanced</review>
      <review>and for many characters right on theme. I had a great time for a long time."]</review>

    <summary>Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza! In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike! What could go wrong? As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office. As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.</summary>

      <review>"I really enjoyed my time reading it and it was the most fun I had reading a visual novel in a quite while. It made me realize just how much I missed Nasu's unique writing. The characters are awesome too. Aoko</review>
      <review>Alice and Sizuki are great and super likable and there banter is really entertaining through out. Hell even the side characters are fun too. The art to the visual novel is also gorgeous easily one of the best I seen from a presentation stand point it sometimes felt like it flowed like a manga which was really cool for a visual novel. The music is also awesome. I also loved the references to other Nasuverse stories while I'm not too familiar with Tsukihime I did catch the many references to Fate/ and Garden of Sinners which was awesome it felt weirdly validating and every time I noticed a reference it made gave me a stupid smile. Also after reading this visual novel I can now say...I will never look Touko the same way ever again. I don't wanna give too much spoilers though since I greatly recommend just reading it yourself."</review>

    <summary>The game follows the title character, the demigod Asura as he seeks revenge on the pantheon of other demigods who betrayed him. The story is presented in the style and format of an episodic series of cinematic shorts, including opening and closing credits, with the gameplay being integrated into the cinematic where players switch between third-person combat and interactive sequences with player input in the form of quick-time event button prompts. Because of its unique style, the game has been described in the media as an "interactive anime". According to the game's producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, Asura's Wrath takes elements from Hinduism and Buddhism and blends them with science fiction, with the main character based on the ever combative and superiority-seeking beings of the same name that are part of the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology.</summary>

      <review>and music are phenomenal</review>
      <review>it leaves you desiring more of a game. There are a ton of cutscenes and QTEs</review>
      <review>and the gameplay itself is fun but nothing of real depth. Don't get me wrong</review>
      <review>I didn't hate it and enjoyed the ride despite this essential being an interactive movie with some shmup or beat 'em sections. The shmup sections I actually found to be tedious and not really all that fun to play. The gameplay in these sections feel like they are too easy and you're just locking on until something blows up</review>
      <review>with little player agency. It lacks weight until the end where the difficulty is cranked in these sections. As previously mentioned</review>
      <review>the combat is serviceable but nothing to really write home about. I think more combos and variety would've put this another tier up. I think the game gets maybe a little too bonkers and self-indulgent at points with Asura and his rage</review>
      <review>but it kind of adds to the insanity of the story. I'd recommend playing this once as it genuinely is a really fun ride. Just don't go into it expecting a DMC or Platinum game level of action game perfection in regards to the combat system and gameplay. 3 1/2 ★"</review>

    <summary>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person puzzle-platformer and action-adventure computer and video game published by Ubisoft. It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989. The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards. The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.</summary>

    <summary>London, 1868. The Industrial Revolution unleashes an incredible age of invention, transforming the lives of millions with technologies once thought impossible. Opportunities created during this period have people rushing to London to engage in this new world, a world no longer controlled by kings, emperors, politicians, or religion, but by a new common denominator: money. Not everyone is able to enjoy the benefits of this boom, however. Despite fueling the engine of the British Empire, workers’ lives are little more than legalized slavery while the top few percent profit from their labor. Living poor and dying young, the lower class unite in protest as a new kind of family, gangs, who turn to a life in the underworld in their struggle to survive. A struggle, until watchful Assassins come to their side and re-ignite an age-old conflict involving London’s leaders that will echo throughout modern history, from the underground up. Introducing Jacob Frye, who with the help of his twin sister Evie, will change the fate of millions in Assassin’s Creed Syndicate. Rise to rally and lead the underworld to break the corrupt stranglehold on London in a visceral adventure filled with action, intrigue, and brutal combat.</summary>

    <summary>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is an action-adventure stealth video game and is the third action-based Metal Gear title made specifically for the PSP. The gameplay consists of two primary modes: Mission and Mother Base. Mission are the actual action sequences of the game where the player must infiltrate an enemy territory or fight a boss, whereas Mother Base is an army management. Some changes have been made to the standard Metal Gear formula: the player is now unable to move or shoot while laying down and while pinned to a wall, making Peace Walker the first game since Metal Gear to lack any crawling ability.</summary>

      <review>'Holy shit I cannot stress enough to get friends if you want to play this. Levels are kinda simple and bosses are damage sponges</review>
      <review>which makes playing this by yourself depressing. With a friend though</review>
      <review>this game is an absolute blast. Bumbling around through the stealth sections with one friend and taking on the bosses with 3 friends is awesome and the highlight of this game. When I first played this by myself I was convinced this was the worst one</review>
      <review>but then going back to play this with a friend going through the series for the first time I had a total blast.'</review>
      <review>'Peace Walker is by all accounts a worthy canonical chapter in the saga</review>
      <review>with its own dignity in terms of the themes covered and consideration for the in-depth development of the characters. On the gameplay experience aspects</review>
      <review>it is also a pretty good transposition of the mechanics from previous games to a handheld console</review>
      <review>especially considering the major limitations of the psp: clearly affected by this are mainly the ai of the enemies</review>
      <review>the complexity of the environments and a certain overall fluidity of the experience</review>
      <review>which can initially seem quite clunky. Good choices were therefore to model the gameplay in a relatively short mission structure</review>
      <review>to increase action sequences over stealth phases and to be inspired by the type of games proposed by the highly successful titles on psp</review>
      <review>such as Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The result is a very fun game with various customization options and a very high level of replayability with an almost arcade-like flavor in improving your gaming execution</review>
      <review>that may annoy those who rightly believe that such a title deserved more attention</review>
      <review>but which in the end</review>
      <review>considering the finished product</review>
      <review>turns out to be decidedly remarkable.'</review>

    <summary>Adventure into a world of unparalleled depth and danger with SquareSoft's Vagrant Story. In this sweeping dungeon-crawling epic you play as Ashley Riot, a young assassin and spy for the organization known as Riskbreakers. Your goal is to unravel a deep and twisted plot and come to terms with the recent death of your wife and child. If this sounds a bit too cerebral never fear. Your path to recapturing your sense of humanity hinges on the destruction of countless vicious monsters and the exploration of dark and dangerous dungeons. Vagrant Story is awash in gorgeous scenery and features designs from Yasumi Matsuno and Akihiko Yoshida, the acclaimed artists and creators behind Final Fantasy Tactics.</summary>

      <review>['The first Yasumi Matsuno game I played.'</review>
      <review>'Great game. A wonderfully told story with easily the best graphics on the platform. This alone warrants a perfect score.'</review>
      <review>"Pretty game decent story but fuck me it's a chore dealing with the menus of this game</review>
      <review>super slow</review>
      <review>average combat</review>
      <review>meh at best."</review>
      <review>'Every second of this game is so cool. The presentation and mechanics are extremely unique.\n \n "I am the reinforcements."'</review>
      <review>'To my mind</review>
      <review>the most beautiful PS1 game and a triumph in character and environment design. Even now when you go back</review>
      <review>watching the cinematics from this game makes it feel so stylish and modern. Just a phenomenal job from an art perspective. I also like playing it</review>
      <review>I just have less to say about that.'</review>
      <review>'Squaresoft was absolutely dominating the RPG genre at the turn of the millennium; Final Fantasy</review>
      <review>Chrono Cross</review>
      <review>and Legend of Mana are just a few examples of the types of games which were experiencing their heyday in the late 5th generation. They dabbled in the action RPG subgenre before</review>
      <review>but with the release of Vagrant Story in 2000</review>
      <review>the "action" aspect was amplified</review>
      <review>and the RPG aspect was significantly toned down. Players expecting a similar experience to previously mentioned games would be in for a big surprise</review>
      <review>as this title lacked all the tropes you would expect in a typical RPG; no levels</review>
      <review>no parties</review>
      <review>no item shops</review>
      <review>no grinding. Vagrant Story\'s main appeal</review>
      <review>at the time and currently</review>
      <review>is its diversion from the norm of what RPGs were expected to be. It\'s no doubt that VS offers quite the unique experience; whether that\'s a good thing or not</review>

      <review>is up for debate.']</review>

      <review>'classic shit. managing your resources made not only the monsters but also yourself into an enemy. sound design is great</review>
      <review>monster design is good (even though theres only like 2)</review>
      <review>and the story is fine but only really matters for the first and the last 10 minutes of the game. plenty of monsters in awkward spots to scare you</review>
      <review>which is appreciated. biggest issue is i wish the environments had more variety</review>

      <review>["To review Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is difficult</review>
      <review>because as a game</review>
      <review>there is always something that could be improved. But</review>
      <review>what we got was still one of the best multiplayer experiences possible on the Nintendo Switch</review>
      <review>and just a huge advancement on the original game. Sunbreak adds a whole new tone to the adventure</review>
      <review>and easily nearly another hundred hours of gameplay within (that is still being updated today). I can't deny that this game</review>
      <review>is so addictive that</review>
      <review>you will find it hard to stop. So many addictive gameplay elements</review>
      <review>new monsters who have incredible new designs</review>
      <review>locales that are just super fun</review>
      <review>and a questline that feels more gothic and engaging to its tone. Sunbreak was the best expansion I could have imagined Rise to get</review>
      <review>and I cannot wait to see where the franchise goes next."</review>
      <review>'raw fun'</review>
      <review>"Personally my fav monster hunter game. It's very newbie friendly!"</review>
      <review>"Sunbreak is an incredible expansion to Monster Hunter Rise that fixes a lot of problems. So many amazing monsters are brought back that we haven't seen in a while and are reworked to make them even better than before. Sunbreak also fixes a lot of difficulty problems that Rise had. It's still not incredibly hard</review>
      <review>but there are plenty of tough fights if you're looking for one. There are so many awesome armor loadouts and build customization. This game is just better than Rise in every way which is to be expected from a Monster Hunter G rank expansion"</review>
      <review>'Favorite Part: Hunting with the SV Squad &lt;3'</review>
      <review>'Excellent expansion</review>
      <review>love all the new and returning monsters</review>
      <review>the three lords are super fun to fight and as someone whose favorite MH game is GU I was delighted to see that much of the roster from that game came back</review>
      <review>all of them with a revamped moveset that increased the difficulty of their fights but at the same time made them more engaging. This is a massive improvement over the base game which left me very unsatisfied</review>
      <review>very similar to how I felt with base World and Iceborne.']</review>

      <review>['Recomendado (aunque peca de usar mucho el 2D)'</review>
      <review>"In my short review of Sonic Robo Blast 2</review>
      <review>I mentioned how I didn't really enjoy Sonic that much and how that game was the most fun I had with anything Sonic related."</review>
      <review>'theres some weird levels that arent fast at all</review>
      <review>but most of the levels are pretty good. i like the aesthetic</review>
      <review>the graphics</review>
      <review>and the music slaps as always. its super short tho</review>
      <review>even for my liking. good game tho. even when the boost trilogy is at its worst</review>
      <review>its just meh'</review>
      <review>"I think the writing is actually all right. Not very good</review>
      <review>but it could certainly be a lot worse. As for the game itself</review>
      <review>it somehow feels both too long and too short at the same time. The Wisps are a neat idea</review>
      <review>and they're fairly fun in execution. And the music for Aquarium Park is great. The bosses are kind of aggressively mediocre aside from the last one</review>
      <review>though."</review>
      <review>"Sonic colors is a bit of an odd game. At the time</review>
      <review>this was the video game that sonic fans desperately needed after critics slammed unleashed and Black Knight</review>
      <review>and people seemed to be pretty happy with this one when it came out</review>
      <review>myself included. However</review>
      <review>I have realized that I don't really come back to this one as often as I do with other sonic games</review>
      <review>and I always wondered why that is. The level themes are all very unique</review>
      <review>the soundtrack is great</review>
      <review>and the gameplay is the boost formula we all know and love</review>
      <review>so why is it that this game didn't stick with me the way most other sonic games didn't? I guess while the gameplay is cool</review>
      <review>most of the level design revolves around controlling sonic in a 2D space</review>
      <review>and I've always been more of a fan of the 3D setpieces sonic runs around instead of the 2D segments in modern sonic levels. That being said</review>
      <review>this game is still very solid</review>
      <review>so I don't think you should sleep on it especially if you like sonic. Just sits in a very weird personal purgatory of mine."</review>
      <review>'Eu realmente tentei jogar Sonic Colors</review>

    <summary>Introducing Mario Strikers: Battle League, a 5-on-5, soccer-like sport with no rules - do whatever it takes to win! Get gritty and try to score the most goals by tackling enemies, using items, and pulling off score-boosting special shots. Super Mario series mainstays like Peach, Toad, and Yoshi put their cleats (and stats) to the pitch and will stop at nothing to score. Customize your characters with gear that can augment their stats and appearance. Take the carnage online or pass the ball to players locally - just look out for the electric fence.</summary>

      <review>['I’ll start with 3 complaints. 1: The sound effect for grinding metal surfaces is nails on a chalkboard painful. I’ve played most of the Tony Hawk games</review>
      <review>never had problems with sfx before and since grinding is one of the main attractions</review>
      <review>this is just sad. 2: Not enough special tricks to choose from especially grabs. 3: The licensed music is kinda bland overall. I wish they did the GTA approach</review>
      <review>have different genre based radio stations</review>
      <review>or just make it really interesting like JSRF</review>

Crime and acts of terror serve as a thin veil to cover up an overarching conspiracy aimed at controlling the future of mankind…</summary>

This game uses levels but it doesn’t detract from the experience they’re well built and structured with shortcuts akin to Dark Souls 1. With it being a prequel of sorts to Nioh 1 it can be played in isolation and I honestly recommend it it’s much tougher than Nioh 1 but because of this it makes it easier to jump into a Nioh 1 playthrough since it’s the same game but with less mechanics overall such as burst counters and Yokai attacks. Worth playing through don’t be discouraged by difficulty or the more daunting things like the loot system and menus.'</review>

Gears of War thrusts gamers into a deep and harrowing story of humankind's epic battle for survival against the Locust Horde, a nightmarish race of creatures that surface from the bowels of the planet. Unlike other shooters, Gears of War is all about teamwork in a big way. All game modes, levels and scenarios are designed specifically to encourage co-operative play, whether it be with A.I. partners or human players (with A.I. teammates designed with specific strengths, weaknesses and personalities.) On top of that, voice recognition will be available for players, and obviously voice chat to discuss strategy with your friends. In addition to voice chat, gamers will be able to experience individualized matchmaking, view player statistics, earn player achievements, customize their games, and build and personalize their gamer profiles over Xbox Live.</summary>

    <summary>Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors, but brings many improvements, such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations, fifteen new characters added to the game's roster, more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay. Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws. Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called "Tekken Force", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame "Tekken Ball", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.</summary>

      <review>['Deserves the praises that it gets. Revolutionized the 3D fighting game genre</review>
      <review>and is basically the Street Fighter 2 for 3D fighters.'</review>
      <review>"you'd think that after tekken 2 set the bar so high</review>
      <review>that there would be nowhere to go but down from here</review>
      <review>but they just kept making the game even better. We have an entirely new fresh set of characters here</review>
      <review>the gameplay has been polished to a fine sheen</review>
      <review>and theres a TON of bonus modes you can play that inadvertently give you practice for the main fighting mode</review>
      <review>which is awesome since the normal training mode labbing can sometimes not be everyones cup of tea. The other gamemodes also give lonely fighters like myself much more to do than just playing arcade mode and getting clapped by dumb AI enemies over and over. This is pretty much the golden standard of tekken</review>
      <review>and there's a reason why this game is rated so highly not just among tekken games</review>
      <review>but even among fighting game titles and overall PS1 games."</review>
      <review>'The first\n \n truly\n \n 3d fighting game</review>
      <review>you can get some really spectacular fights especially if you know what you\'re doing (which i don\'t). Unfortunately the spectacle is reserved for a fraction of the characters. A quarter of the roster is complete dogshit</review>
      <review>and another quarter is just kinda "meh". Playing a character as bland as nina after flipping and kicking around with eddy is just too jarring.'</review>
      <review>'I need a hero and Jin is the hero in this game. 5/5'</review>
      <review>'just kinda love the style of this. the soundtrack is awesome and the characters are awesome and i love sidestepping!!!!!'</review>
      <review>'A huge step up from the last two entries of the series. The AI can be challenging</review>
      <review>but not unfair and the combat feels so smooth. The side modes in this game are really fun</review>
      <review>Tekken Force being a great addition. The cinematics are great and tell fun stories while also boasting a big step up visually compared to its predecessor. Tekken 3 really is still worth trying</review>
      <review>even over 20 years later.']</review>

    <summary>Xenosaga: Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht, the first chapter of a trilogy, is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game, sharing many common themes and gameplay elements with Xenogears. The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's "boost" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts. Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.</summary>

      <review>["definitely more cutscene than game here</review>

      <review>the plot and characters are really neat and the game definitely kept me on the edge of my seat as i watched the cool space shenanigans that the party goes through. This game does an incredible job at introducing the world and characters in a way where I really got to know them but at the same time still was intrigued by the backstories and future that they would have in later games."</review>
      <review>'Plot and cutscenes are 9/10. References to Xenogears are neat.\n \n Gameplay is mid and boring</review>
      <review>and slow (God bless turbo button). Even tho I somehow enjoyed stats synchronization mechanic</review>
      <review>but I think it\'s not a feature</review>
      <review>but an overlooked game design flaw - won\'t complain</review>
      <review>being OP is funny.\n \n Also didn\'t like (too) easy to miss stuff - forgot to return to the room you left right now - you will miss entire sidequest with generous reward.\n \n Also game has really obscure secrets where you need to be in particular place controlling particular character (them being in your party isn\'t enough).\n \n My "favorite" one is playground in the beginning of the dungeon</review>
      <review>you need to travel for about 20 minutes</review>
      <review>just to get a card for a hidden minigame.\n \n It feels like they made it for replayability</review>
      <review>but again in the end of the game there is a big middle finger for those who will decide to save clear data on the same save slot. Because you can\'t load clear data - it\'s for sequel to get few bonuses (swimsuits and something else). There\'s no NG+</review>
      <review>there\'s no way to start from checkpoint before final boss</review>
      <review>you just wasted all your progress. You also lose access to all minigames - therefore gameplay is 3/10\n \n I don\'t remember any music during gameplay but in cutscenes it was good - 7/10'</review>

      <review>porém não deixa de ser bom.'</review>
      <review>"When I initially played Pokemon Gold</review>
      <review>I was fairly harsh on it. I didn't enjoy the lack of content in-between gyms and the lack of Team Rockets presence throughout the game. Pokemon Ruby on the other hand fixes a lot of what I didn't like about the previous generation.\n \n There's far more to do in-between gyms this time</review>
      <review>with an actual plot you would want to progress that goes beyond being the very best</review>
      <review>like no one ever was. After beating a gym</review>
      <review>you usually have some other quests or tasks you can do before the next one</review>
      <review>which I super appreciate. Running from gym to gym gets incredibly boring to me</review>
      <review>so this game keeping things new and interesting is nice.\n \n Team Magma is a far better villain than Team Rocket in Pokemon Gold. You could forget that Team Rocket was even there</review>
      <review>but Team Magma is always up to something that furthers their goal</review>
      <review>and it's your job to stop them. The climax of their arc was genuinely pretty tense with the music and the new screen filter.\n \n There is a lot more polish here as well. It doesn't push the GBA to its absolute limit like the previous 2 gens did with the Gameboy</review>
      <review>but it still looks nice. Everything is so much more crisp and alive with the power the GBA provides</review>
      <review>and there are some nice QOL improvements in different areas.\n \n However</review>
      <review>the end can be really grindy. Especially when you get to the elite four. They were so far above me in everything that I spent hours and hours level grinding in victory road so that I had a chance. The difficulty curve is a bit weird in this game</review>
      <review>with way too steep of a spike at the end. That ends up being my only real issue with it other than me just not liking random encounters.\n \n Pokemon Red and Gold will always be appreciated for being the start of Pokemon</review>

    <summary>Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection is a remastered compilation of the action-adventure shooter platform video games Drake's Fortune, Among Thieves, and Drake's Deception. Ported by Bluepoint Games, the collection was released exclusively for the PlayStation 4 on October 7, 2015 in Europe and October 9th, 2015 in North America. The Nathan Drake Collection features the original three games in the Uncharted series with 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second, better lighting, textures and models. The collection also implements a "Photo Mode", a mode where the player can freeze the game at any moment to take personalized screenshots, derived from Naughty Dog's other remastered entry, The Last of Us Remastered, as well as new trophies. The ported games only include their respective single-player modes. The pre-ordered version of The Nathan Drake Collection includes the "Nathan Drake Pack", which consists of single-player skins of iconic Nathan Drake outfits, as well as two weapons: the Golden AK-47 and Golden 92FS - 9mm. Pre-ordering the collection as a digital download through the PlayStation Store would also give an exclusive Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection PlayStation 4 dynamic theme. Purchasing The Nathan Drake Collection, and owning a valid subscription to PlayStation Plus, before the expiry date of December 13, 2015 would grant the player exclusive access to the multiplayer beta of A Thief's End.</summary>

      <review>en modelar los modelos de diseños de niveles y de los mechas al 3D con una ampliación muy vista y amplia en una cámara al aire libre con jugabilidad en tercera persona y un esquema de control tanque para que los desarrolladores acentúen controles muy a lo resident evil y el resultado les salió bien. Con unas misiones sencillas pero entretenidas pero que no arruinan el pacing y con un buen posicionamiento de enemigos. También que la mecanica de «fijar en blanco a un enemigo» funciona muy bien con la cohesión del control tanque para fijar a alguien en concreto sobre todo en oleadas de enemigos que funciona muy bien esta mecánica de juego y hace que no sea tan injusto.

    <summary>Wanted: Dead promises "spectacular melee combat and exciting gunplay," and is set in a "dark and dangerous version of science-fiction Hong Kong where you will need sharpened skills to survive."</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["It's really weird that the narrative around this game has become that it's some kind of corporate money laundering affair or some other cheap passionless writeoff when it's just</review>
      <review>like</review>
      <review>no? Obviously this is an extreme passion vanity project the likes of which rarely gets mass distribution in video games even in the indie scene</review>
      <review>let alone a boxed product by a reputable developer. This is more like something that would get dropped by Pendulum Pictures on a box of 50 shot on video flicks than anything else. And guess what? That is my\n \n entire\n \n vibe.\n \n Every moment of a cutscene in this game is an unhinged surreal delight</review>
      <review>CGI PS360 cutscene anime filtered through 9 layers of google translate. I can't tell you a thing that happened in this game but I can tell you that Herzog's stories have more male nudity in them than a Joaquin Phoenix movie and I did a stunningly difficult karaoke minigame to 99 Luftballoons while my character and Stephanie Joosten looked like they were singing at gunpoint.\n \n The weirdness carries over into the traditional levels too</review>
      <review>with dialogue peppered in and just an incredible awkwardness to every combat encounter. Guns are formally useless (one of the things I think is surprisingly worse about this game next to Devil's Third</review>
      <review>a modern gaming classic) and swordplay is very simplistic</review>
      <review>but there's fun to be had in the RSI inducing button mashing</review>
      <review>mostly because it's really difficult so you have to actually learn parries and shit. There are encounters that are like pulling fucking teeth though</review>
      <review>the boss fight against August is one of the absolute worst I can remember</review>
      <review>the game is just not fair or deep or varied lol. It is fun tho. I like the lil hub zone too</review>
      <review>love a hub</review>
      <review>love wandering around hearing the inscrutable cop dialogue.\n \n This game is set in Hong Kong but there's like no Chinese characters at all?\n \n Also it's explicitly set in 2022 so I guess it's alt history?\n \n Sometimes the cutscenes are anime?\n \n Sometimes you see actual Stephanie Joosten playing with her band?"</review>
      <review>"Wanted: Dead is when Soleil games played one of D3 Publisher's many bargain bin action games like Onechanbara but realized they didn't have the talent to actually make something closely on par. Soleil also clearly doesn't have the humility to price Wanted: Dead as the unfinished bargain bin title it is</review>
      <review>either. Skip it."</review>
      <review>"This game is not very good. I had a very good time though. It’s flawed</review>
      <review>but oozes charm. Like</review>
      <review>the bizarre dialogue coupled with iffy voice acting with an extra dose of horrible sound mixing should be a recipe for a bad time. But I found it very endearing. The actual story is not good</review>
      <review>though. It starts off interesting</review>
      <review>but has absolutely zero pay-off in any way</review>
      <review>shape</review>
      <review>or form. I don’t know if this is a time or budget constraint or it’s just bad on its own. Either way</review>
      <review>it doesn't really matter to me.\n \n The gameplay is a mix of linear combat levels</review>
      <review>with some minigames and exploration of the police station in between them. The minigames are fun on the first go</review>
      <review>but I never went back for seconds. And exploring the station was fun the first time</review>
      <review>but after that you just kinda mindlessly run around it looking for new intel pick-ups after every level. It’s nothing special</review>
      <review>but offers a nice repose from the combat. The combat is pretty simple</review>
      <review>but effective. You have a sword</review>
      <review>and some guns. I mostly played aggressively</review>
      <review>not using guns for the most part. Just slashing around</review>
      <review>and finding it very fun. Attacking</review>
      <review>and parrying. This being a game made by former Ninja Gaiden devs</review>
      <review>I’m sure there’s plenty of secret techniques that deepen the combat. But I’m a scrub</review>
      <review>and don’t know anything about that. I did discover block canceling tho</review>
      <review>and felt like a genius. The actual game is pretty hard. Those ninjas</review>
      <review>man… A nice challenge is a good thing</review>
      <review>but the checkpoint placement really grinded my gears. Dying could mean having to repeat like 5 minutes of constant combat which gets pretty annoying. But other than that</review>
      <review>I honestly had a fun time."</review>
      <review>'"Damn I wish they still made rough janky action games that got critically eviscerated like the PS2 days. No no not like that it\'s too rough and janky</review>
      <review>and look at those reviews it\'s being critically eviscerated"'</review>
      <review>'You know I knew exactly what I was getting into with this game and yet somehow I still left disappointed lol. While this game has a lot of charm and fun combat ( can be clunky at times ) there is still so much wrong with this game.'</review>
      <review>"As someone who saw promise in the developer’s previous works</review>
      <review>and after seeing the interesting flavor Wanted: Dead was putting on display in its advertising</review>
      <review>I was truly hopeful that the game would finally squeak past that threshold of being just short of greatness and deliver something flawed but truly excellent or interesting in its own right. Unfortunately</review>

Armed with his trusty Poltergust ghost-sucking vacuum cleaner, Mario's brother takes center stage to capture these pesky phantoms. Luigi's Mansion 2: Dark Moon gives players multiple mansions to explore, a variety of puzzles to solve and new ghosts to capture. Armed with the Poltergust 5000, a ghost-sucking, vacuum-like invention, Luigi must complete a number of missions assigned to him by Professor E. Gadd.</summary>

      <review>milk toast experience. Next level games always had an eye for great character animations and this title has plenty of that. But great animations doesn't excuse the downright inferior ghost designs (the fucking thing looks like minion knock offs) and the constant back n forth made it a slog to get through. You may say that the first game is similar with the backtracking. Though I feel the first title is all about exploring this one environment making you attached to it.

    <reviews>
      <review>["Valkyrie Elysium truly is a long-lost PS3 game that took its time to come out. I'm happy that the Valkyrie franchise is back in some capacity</review>
      <review>I think after this game it's gonna be a while till we get something else but I will take my wins whenever."</review>
      <review>"So</review>
      <review>to start off...my first thought about this game when I saw it was it was a sequel to the Valkyrie Profile series. That's not quite what this is</review>
      <review>but I'll explain what I mean below."</review>
      <review>'Game looks kinda nice I guess. Takes the Valkyrie game series name and uses it as toilet paper though.'</review>
      <review>'As my first time playing a Valkyrie game</review>
      <review>it fell a little flat. Combat is actually really fun and is ultimately what kept me playing. The story is a bit bare but the companions you pick up along the way have a charm of their own. The environments are beautiful but a little bland although this IS a game about a world already in ruin. This music is pretty cool and I enjoyed the multiple endings. Ultimately I had fun.'</review>
      <review>'I think the most interesting thing about Valkyrie Elysium is that it’s not a story about saving the world. It’s about what happens in that period where everything is ending already. Most of my time playing this game was spent in ruins</review>
      <review>fighting the vengeful spirits that still roam the land alongside those spirits who chose to fight with me and listening to the voices that had long perished. And although Odin tells you from the beginning that your efforts are done so save it</review>
      <review>actually walking through Valkyrie Elysiums world</review>
      <review>the question haunted me: What is there left so save? This question is at the heart of the game. [Spoilers follow] The Valkyrie</review>
      <review>a hollow shell at the beginning</review>
      <review>distanced from the world she wants to save</review>
      <review>becomes more and more involved over the course of the story – through the help of the spirits that chose to stay with her. And in the end</review>
      <review>the player must choose what to do with that involvement. The different endings all give a different answer to the questions “What is there left to save? What is there left to fight for?”. The so-called “true ending” has a somewhat cynical answer to this: That the gods who were responsible for the worlds’ demise will not see the next one. Another ending plainly states: heterosexual love. In every ending the world we walked through in the game ends. The agency of the player is to decide what happens next.'</review>
      <review>'This feels like a low budget PS2 game and I mean that as a compliment. It has a fun battle system and it looks nice. The rest of the game</review>
      <review>however</review>
      <review>is for lack of a better term</review>
      <review>fucking boring. The story is generic</review>
      <review>the stage design is bland</review>
      <review>and while I do like a few characters</review>
      <review>they are also generic.']</review>

      <review>['Since I just played the first one too most of my opinions are basically comparisons</review>
      <review>but I do think both games are very good with different highs and lows between the two. This one has an actual story this time</review>
      <review>unlike the last one which was a collection of somewhat thrown together "get to and beat the guy" levels threaded together loosely (especially in the DS version). This time there\'s a thread that runs from the start to the end and is helped by the new-to-the-series voiced characters and script which thankfully doesn\'t quite fall into the overly quirky style that later games would become defined by. The levels</review>
      <review>while occasionally a little too long</review>
      <review>are still very engaging though i\'m not sure which games levels really kept my attention better. Despite being "DC Super Heroes" it\'s still hugely Batman skewed</review>
      <review>you\'d have to wait for another sequel to really reach into more DC character territory</review>
      <review>but this one had a nice roster of fun characters. I didn\'t have much interest in 100%ing this time round but i\'ve definitely come close before from what I remember</review>
      <review>just that it takes a while and i\'m not sure I want to play the same levels twice in a row immediately. Lego games have always been a bit of a pain to really fully complete</review>
      <review>but this was definitely fun and a nice trip down memory lane for the time spent with it.'</review>
      <review>'peak'</review>
      <review>'This game... IS SO GOOD'</review>

      <review>'For the asking price</review>
      <review>this is perfect 3d platformer. Amazing controls</review>
      <review>great level design and lovely aesthetics. Wish there was more.'</review>
      <review>'kind of a chore demo</review>
      <review>not very interesting to play'</review>
      <review>"This was an extremely cute little platformer that has a lot of care and love put into it. Fantastic music and a GORGEOUS artstyle</review>
      <review>where every level has interesting things about it. The collecting is really nice too</review>
      <review>as someone who doesn't like having to one-hundred percent games I definitely want to do it with this game as the levels are setup to minimize backtracking if you're trying to get everything. The music as well needs to be mentioned</review>
      <review>as it is amazing and fits every level's unique artstyle perfectly. It is a bit on the shorter side but I'd rather have a game that leaves me wanting more rather than thinking it was too much. I think my biggest complaint is that it is a little too easy. I don't normally play platformers and I found it not that challenging</review>
      <review>where I usually messed up jumps because of timing rather than precision and movement. I don't mind games being easy</review>
      <review>but I think I would've liked a little more challenge</review>
      <review>especially with the enemies. They're all quite simple and are more objects rather than creatures you counter despite their cute designs. I also liked the little story details we get and it really plays well into the 'less is more' concept. Overall a great game and for the price it is a steal!"</review>
      <review>'Love the visuals a lot'</review>
      <review>'This game is an absolute treat! It\'s everything that I want out of a retro-styled platformer. Tight controls</review>
      <review>visuals are captivating</review>
      <review>the stages themselves are well designed and each area has some unique hooks</review>
      <review>and the collectibles are fun to track down. I also enjoyed the "plot" undertones throughout</review>
      <review>would be interesting to explore more of the direction the game was going in a sequel.']</review>

Sonic Advance features four playable characters and marks the first playable appearance of Amy Rose on a 2D title. The game borrows elements from the original Sonic the Hedgehog titles for the Sega Genesis, but with the post-Dreamcast artstyle for the characters which was introduced in Sonic Adventure. The game also includes multiplayer features and mini-games. The title was also ported to the Nokia N-Gage under the title "SonicN".</summary>

    <summary>EarthBound Beginnings is the first installment in the EarthBound / Mother series. It was developed by Ape Inc., Nintendo Tokyo R&amp;D Products, and Pax Softnica, and was published by Nintendo for the Famicom on July 27, 1989. Though officially translated into English under the name EarthBound in 1990 complete with a variety of updates and new content, the planned release of the North American localization was ultimately cancelled due to Nintendo of America ending support for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Despite this, the updates made to the game for the English localization was included in the Japanese Mother 1+2 rerelease for Game Boy Advance in 2003. The English version was finally released on the Wii U Virtual Console on June 14th, 2015, 25 years after its intended release date.</summary>

      <review>nothing too grand or deep but I enjoyed it a bit. I don't see myself ever returning to this game with all its grinding and such. It's nice to have completed it though."</review>
      <review>"Definitely is not exempt of the many tropes that 8-bit RPGs fall victim to in terms of difficulty and grind</review>
      <review>yeeesh the random encounter rate is nuts and mt. itoi will kick your ass. Despite that though</review>
      <review>it's honestly a bit of a vibe. Lays the groundwork for the mother games to follow while at the same time having things unique with a much more open world-y map where you can do things at your own pace rather than the more linear design of its sequels. Kinda dragon questy in that regard. If you can take the heat this is honestly one of the more interesting 8-bit RPGs."</review>
      <review>'On one hand</review>

      <review>['It’s not every time I write about a game I feel the need to say a lot about it.\n \n Wario Land 3 is a very strange but importantly to me</review>
      <review>interesting game.\n \n I don’t want to write much because right now I feel my “review” will be more just a straight description or thousands or words questioning my own opinions and going back and forth.\n \n This</review>
      <review>for the most part</review>
      <review>is a good thing.\n \n However can I recommend it</review>
      <review>do I think overall the game itself is good and not just a curious thing?\n \n I’m more inclined to say “check it out” because it’s “free” on Nintendo Switch Online.\n \n It does a lot to test your patience but also does a decent amount to surprise you.\n \n Grab a couple of treasures</review>
      <review>save and come back later. It’ll make the game a little longer than you’d expect but this is the way I did it and found it easy to digest</review>
      <review>and don’t worry</review>
      <review>you can always find where you should be going every time if you do get overwhelmed but how the map and abilities have opened up.'</review>
      <review>'The best Wario Land.'</review>
      <review>"This is a frail attempt at a metroidvania. It's fine and Wario moves fun</review>
      <review>but it gets to a point where you want it to end more than you do actually want to keep going. Wario's upgrades aren't significant enough to be fun and interesting and all the environments are disconnected so it's harder to remember where everything is. The best thing about this game is that for some reason it inspired Dr. Mario 64."</review>
      <review>'This is a game where you have to use your brain for once! NEato!'</review>

      <review>and how it could be personalized to each person. this game takes that and cranks it to a MILLION!!! the graphics honestly are nothing to write home about</review>
      <review>but the whole atari aesthetic contributed to the entire dark and desolate feel of the game. the rotoscoped cutscenes too looked cool! at first the story seemed a little surface level but as the game goes on and the more into hell you spiral</review>

      <review>["The ugliest game I've ever played."</review>
      <review>'Hands down one of the best games of all time</review>
      <review>if not the best game of all-time. When looking at it in reverse I cannot really find one thing or component to the game that is bad. Of course it is not perfect but FF VII has some of the best and polished turn-based RPG combat/gameplay systems (materia</review>
      <review>limits</review>
      <review>leveling). The mechanics are simple at its core but can get much deeper depending on how much the player wants to fiddle around. Likely the best game soundtrack/score of all time. 10/10'</review>
      <review>"Ignoring the historical significance &amp; how groundbreaking it was during the time</review>
      <review>this is still a pretty respectable game. Despite myself personally not being a fan of turn-based combat</review>
      <review>I can appreciate the materia system alleviating some of the monotnous menu scrolling of older titles. Great soundtrack</review>
      <review>characters</review>
      <review>story</review>
      <review>etc; this delivers on everything that someone would want from a JRPG. With that being said</review>
      <review>like most early 3D games the graphics have aged like sour milk. While having the chibi artstyle does help</review>
      <review>the game overall still shows it's age."</review>
      <review>"Finally played this iconic game for the first time</review>
      <review>and boy does it not age well</review>
      <review>especially with the reputation and legacy it has garnered. I first tried to play this without any mods and found the experience pretty miserable. Ugly graphics</review>
      <review>tedious random encounters</review>
      <review>a poor localization</review>
      <review>and mediocre writing - a far cry from the best JRPG of all time. With the right combination of mods</review>
      <review>however</review>
      <review>it becomes an enjoyable experience. I could see myself loving this game as it is if I had first approached it in the 1990s. Today though</review>
      <review>I can't really recommend it without mods. I think nostalgia colors a lot of people's memories about this game."</review>
      <review>"I really dislike what Square turned FFVII into nowadays</review>
      <review>but as it's own game</review>
      <review>it is still a fucking incredible instilment in the series</review>

      <review>"Decent game. Great pixel art</review>
      <review>decent OST</review>
      <review>and the gameplay bangs to an extent. I think that if there were more in game incentives to make the player try new moves and experiment with different combos it would enhance the whole experience tenfold</review>
      <review>since earlygame unlocking new moves was exciting with trying to lab out cool combos</review>
      <review>but by lategame I was mostly just spamming the one combo I know that worked to defeat most encounters</review>
      <review>which gets kinda boring. Theres a dab move though</review>
      <review>so this game is turbo based on that basis alone. The writing and the voice acting delivery of said writing was kinda cringe to me personally but idk other people might like it.

    <summary>The story begins when Kururin’s brothers and sisters go missing, and it is up to him to find them. Kururin is initially unsure that he is up to the task because he has never left his home world before. Being the adventurous and helpful fellow he is, Kururin agrees to rescue his lost family. Teacher Hare trains Kururin in the art of controlling the Helirin, a stick-shaped helicopter that has a slow-spinning propeller. Piloting the Helirin through the different worlds will be a difficult task, but using Teacher Hare's valuable lessons, Kururin bravely sets out on his adventure to rescue his lost family.</summary>

    <summary>Humorous action-platformer that does away with the tedious item collection found in most games in the genre. Instead, BFD employs a combination of standard jump, run and explore mechanics and context-sensitive gags and actions. For instance, in the beginning of the game, by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters, Conker drinks some Alka-Seltzer to wipe out his hangover, at which point players can proceed forward. Later on these pads are used to activate a slingshot and throwing knives; to turn Conker into an anvil and drop downward; to shoot automatic, double-handed guns; to activate a The Matrix-inspired slow-motion effect and flip through the air shooting enemies; and much, much more.</summary>

    <summary>Radiant Dawn is a turn-based tactics RPG and a direct sequel, 3 years have passed, to the game "Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance" for the Nintendo GameCube. It features new magic, class upgrades, weapons, and a reworked forging system. The game uses a somewhat upgraded version of the previous engine so the games look similar. You can carry over some data from the previous games save file but only a normal or hard mode file will work because a bug will cause the Wii to freeze if an easy mode save file is on the GameCube memory card.</summary>

      <review>so maybe I will have a better feeling of this game playing it again knowing the full story and not being disappointed I don't get to see Ike until like Part 3 of the game."</review>

    <summary>Braid is a puzzle-platformer, drawn in a painterly style, where you can manipulate the flow of time in strange and unusual ways. From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more. Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world.</summary>

      <review>I feel like it\'s the game of that Indie Game: The Movie trifecta that left the smallest footprint</review>
      <review>if any. Super Meat Boy drove the 2d platformer renaissance for Western developers and Fez presented a world of puzzles so enigmatic and dense</review>
      <review>yet drenched in an alluring aesthetic that you couldn\'t help but dive deeper into the pool. Meanwhile</review>
      <review>Braid had uhhh mediocre at best platforming</review>
      <review>puzzles that have left no lasting impression on me</review>
      <review>an aesthetic comparable to a sack of potatoes</review>
      <review>and hamfisted attempts at artistic concepts such as "What if Mario</review>
      <review>but in Real Life?" and "You can reverse time in the game</review>
      <review>but you can\'t in real life. Anyways</review>
      <review>humans created the atom bomb." I truly hated my time with it and I don\'t think I\'ll ever understand the praise it receives</review>
      <review>but hey isn\'t that quite apt when the creator of the art I\'m critiquing says that critics shouldn\'t criticize the art that they don\'t "truly" understand the point of? Who decides "the point" of a piece of art anyways? I guess the artist "truly" knows what their intention was when they made it</review>
      <review>but is intention always the same as "the point"? The intention behind dropping two nukes on an enemy nation might be to deal heavy damage and weaken the opposing forces</review>
      <review>but "the point" is to establish an overwhelming aura of dominance that ripples through generations. Did you like me comparing this dude\'s attempts at artistry to the nuclear bombings of Japan in WWII? No? Was it too much? Yeah I guess that\'s fair. Anyways</review>
      <review>my wife left me for the Chad Knight in that other castle.'</review>
      <review>"It's still a very interesting and fun game</review>
      <review>some aspects of it haven't aged well</review>
      <review>but it's more good than worth complaining about."</review>
      <review>'Always weird to pick up games again that you thought were really good when you were 14!'</review>
      <review>'Reminder that this guy is on Jordan Peterson’s patreon and said that Japanese games were soulless and shat on them along with Phil Fish\n \n Soulja was right'</review>
      <review>"Puzzle design is fine</review>
      <review>but sometimes the mechanics need a bit more tutorial</review>
      <review>as much as Jonathan Blow hates it. The control of the platforming is not good and adds to the frustration. Story tries too hard to impress</review>
      <review>but doesn't have enough substance. Art and sound are monotonous for a four hour experience. so the game is better played piecemeal."</review>
      <review>'It likes to smell its own farts sometimes</review>

    <summary>Metro 2033 is a first-person shooter with survival horror elements, based on the Russian book of the same name by Dmitry Glukhovsky. Most of the game takes place underground, but several times Artyom will have to venture outside, into the perpetual nuclear winter. Game progression is fairly linear, though areas may be explored more thoroughly for items and ammunition. Setpieces include a few on-rails sequences, missions that involve defending a location from an onslaught of monsters, and others. A few stages can be completed in a stealthy fashion.</summary>

    <summary>Kentucky Route Zero is a magical realist adventure game about a secret highway in the caves beneath Kentucky, and the mysterious folks who travel it. Gameplay is inspired by point-and-click adventure games (like the classic Monkey Island or King's Quest series, or more recently Telltale's Walking Dead series), but focused on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling rather than clever puzzles or challenges of skill. The game is developed by Cardboard Computer (Jake Elliott and Tamas Kemenczy). The game's soundtrack features an original electronic score by Ben Babbitt along with a suite of old hymns &amp; bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers.</summary>

      <review>with each copy ability having four different abilities depending on whether or not you have an animal friend and which animal friend you have.

I dislike meandering story-telling where all of the characters are idiots and the pacing is constantly slowed down to explain things to you or being forced to "regroup" and stop your exploration.\n \n I\'ve just been having such a hard time getting into JRPGs lately</review>
      <review>even though it used to be one of my favourite genres to play</review>
      <review>and I dislike that I don\'t have the patience for this genre any more. As an adult and having to manage my time to make a place for things I enjoy like gaming and movies and reading</review>
      <review>I really appreciate a game that doesn\'t waste my time more than anything else in the world.'</review>
      <review>"The game is pretty clunky in many aspects:\n \n -plot is really bad (shitty time travel plot with clueless MC in medieval(relative to the world) times. am I supposed to scream in joy and feel smart when I hear about nanomachines</review>
      <review>robots and other futuristic shit that every character is clueless about in a FARMING SIM.)\n \n -combat is a snoozefest with overly big dungeons\n \n -progression is fucked beyond repair (you need to play ungodly amount of time to upgrade tools</review>
      <review>not sure if you ever get an opportunity to befriend characters (not that any of them are likeable enough)\n \n -you do quests for generic NPC's (why? totally blows social aspect from farming sims that people look for)\n \n - in medieval(relative to the world) times every dude looks like a femboy and I'm not talking about NB-gay-whatever shit that makes people avoid this game"</review>
      <review>"Can actually play as non-binary for once! 🙏\n \n Really\n \n makes a difference</review>
      <review>considering the protagonist is meant to be relatively self-insert.\n \n Graphics on Switch version are often very bleary</review>
      <review>especially noticeable in handheld mode. Shame</review>
      <review>because it's otherwise very pretty. The character art is lovely.\n \n Engaging gameplay</review>
      <review>allowing the player to create their own balance between farming and JRPG elements</review>
      <review>without forcing either. It is more JRPG than it is farming sim (the farming doesn't have the same depth as is found in others of the genre)</review>
      <review>but one can take the quests and story at their own pace.\n \n Varied job system</review>
      <review>and the story is interesting enough so far. Has side quests I actually want to do.\n \n Appealing characters (moreso for me when compared with other farming life sims). Everyone has nice voice acting – too bad it's limited to small lines here and there.\n \n Romance options are not gender-locked~\n \n And the music is lovely... Would definitely purchase the soundtrack if they release that."</review>
      <review>'Ich mag den Mix aus Farming Simulation und JRPG auch wenn das Storytelling etwas plump ist und nicht wirklich spannend erzählt. Die Dialoge sind sehr inhaltlos aber das Gameplay macht Spaß und unterhält.']</review>

    <summary>Colossal, immense, and gigantic; beautiful, gorgeous, and grandiose -- these are the words one thinks of when describing Rare's follow-up adventure to Banjo-Kazooie. Keeping consistent with the attitude found in this title, Rare has wittily named it Banjo-Tooie. Banjo-Tooie, simply put, is incredibly unimaginable. The worlds are ludicrous in size, the gameplay is polished and deep, and the soundtrack proves to be an immaculate compliment. When it comes to defining platform-based entertainment, Banjo-Tooie is filled with chapter after chapter of standards. Explore eight giant worlds, solve puzzles and help game characters to unearth jiggys, play as Mumbo, a T-Rex, Submarine, Money-Van, Washing Machine, and more, and learn more than 40 new moves on the way.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["I already love Banjo-Kazooie. It's not really nostalgia</review>
      <review>maybe a bit</review>
      <review>but I do think it's pretty fun the whole way through</review>
      <review>with some clear flaws. Tooie fixes every problem the first has</review>
      <review>and expands on it in so many ways it's kind of hard to believe."</review>
      <review>'Watching paint dry over here. I thought Banjo 1 was tedious</review>
      <review>but this stretches the world out to double the length and forces a bunch of transformations that make you walk across it 3-4 times more than the original game. I didnt grow up playing this one so its automatically worse than banjo 1.'</review>
      <review>'While Ill always think the N64 was home to some of the worst gamefeel ever made</review>
      <review>its hard to deny it had a really unique design culture. Banjo Tooie has a bunch of fun ideas but fuck the Minjos</review>
      <review>Im glad the mole guy died.'</review>
      <review>'A great sequel to an amazing game</review>
      <review>keeping things fresh while also staying true to the original'</review>
      <review>'One of my favorite games of all time.\n \n Banjo Tooie is a 3D platformer collect-a-thon. A lot of its charm comes from the humorous dialogue between characters. It’s packed with quite a bit of dark humor and situational comicalities throughout each of the 9 worlds.\n \n The worlds are vast and eclectic</review>
      <review>meaning you’re left with very little to be desired and a lot to explore.\n \n Being a sequel to Banjo Kazooie</review>
      <review>Tooie has a lot to live up to and it did not disappoint. I didn’t really want to compare the two</review>
      <review>but oh well</review>
      <review>everyone else is 🤷🏻\u200d♂️.\n \n One key difference is that in Kazooie</review>
      <review>each session in a world is somewhat discontinuous. What this means is you can collect 99 music notes in a world</review>
      <review>leave and come back</review>
      <review>and you’ll have to start back at 0. Whereas in Tooie</review>
      <review>everything you collect is permanent and you don’t need to worry about losing progress.\n \n Tooie is a lot more legato when it comes to how the worlds are interconnected and honestly that was something I really loved when playing it.\n \n Oh</review>
      <review>the camera is much better in Tooie too.\n \n A common complaint I see is that there’s an overwhelming amount of content and people that played Tooie after Kazooie thought that took away from the experience. I actually played Tooie first and felt that Kazooie was lacking.\n \n One significant aspect of games that greatly affects the flow of a game is the feeling of progression. This is something I think Banjo Tooie does extremely well. There are consistently new unlockables whether it’s new combat moves</review>
      <review>mobility utilities</review>
      <review>worlds</review>
      <review>secret paths</review>
      <review>etc</review>
      <review>there’s always something new. However</review>
      <review>because there’s so much</review>
      <review>there is a LOT of backtracking</review>
      <review>especially if you want to collect everything. For me this was a good thing</review>
      <review>but I know it’s not for everyone.\n \n There are many places in each world where you can get stuck due to not having unlocked something elsewhere or just not being able to figure out a puzzle. As a child</review>
      <review>this was a fun challenge. I cannot tell what it would be like playing for the first time as an adult.\n \n I’d be lying if I said nostalgia didn’t have something to do with how I feel about this game. But I assure you</review>
      <review>both playing (and 100%ing) as a kid as well as in my 20’s I gave this a solid 10/10.\n \n There’s also a multiplayer mode which are all the mini games banjo and kazooie come across in the campaign. I had 3 siblings so we had a ton of fun playing these</review>
      <review>but I imagine not many of us play couch multiplayer anymore so this is more of a side note bonus thing.'</review>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages is one of two Zelda titles released for the Game Boy Color, the other being Oracle of Seasons. The game retain many gameplay elements from Link's Awakening such as the graphics, audio and top-view perspective. It also features eight dungeons and a large overworld to explore like in the previous games. Oracle of Ages is said to be more puzzle-oriented than its counterpart being more action-oriented. After completing one of the two games, both can be linked to form a single linear plot with an alternate ending. Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons were often credited as being two of the top games for the Game Boy Color.</summary>

      <review>['Dungeons are a bit too convoluted tbh. On to Seasons'</review>
      <review>'NOVO'</review>
      <review>'Like I stated in my Seasons review</review>
      <review>these two games together craft one of the most unique Zelda experiences out there. Especially with the way you link together the secrets.'</review>
      <review>"This is probably the worst official single player Zelda that isn't lost to time. There's no interesting plot or characters</review>
      <review>the world is boring and uninspired in terms of both its design and its contents</review>
      <review>there's no notable music</review>
      <review>the bosses are awful</review>
      <review>the bafflingly terrible changes made to the game feel and dungeon layouts done by Capcom are just as prominent here as they are in OoS</review>
      <review>but by far the worst aspect is the dungeons. They use the same rotating center wall gimmick multiple times in both games</review>
      <review>and by the end it just feels lazy. Speaking of lazy</review>
      <review>yeah why not lock the boss key in dungeon 6 behind RANDOM CHANCE?????"</review>
      <review>'Oracle of Ages\n \n was slightly more enjoyable than\n \n Seasons\n \n</review>
      <review>but still had a few frustrating moments.'</review>
      <review>"Good dungeons but I have a really hard time figuring out where to go between them. Something about the more compact world design and overt puzzle focus makes me totally lose my sense of direction</review>
      <review>and the map doesn't really help at all. I feel like I'll probably like Seasons better."]</review>

      <review>it was also quite a difficult game to proceed through gameplay wise.

    <summary>Time refuses to forget the Belmont family's horrifying, bloody destiny. And in 1917 two of its descendants are summoned by fate into epic battle. Their enemy? The most evil incarnation of Castlevania legacy to ever rise from the grave, the vampiress Countess Bartley. This spine-tingling, 6-stage fear-fest overflows with graphic sights and sounds from your worst nightmares. As John Morris, the whip wielding vampire hunter, or Eric Lecarde, master lanceman, you'll pursue the demonic Countess all across Europe before she resurrects Dracula for a final reign of global terror. Alas, her trail of doom is laden with zombies, hideous mutants, grotesque giants, ghouls and ghastly creatures. Taste the sweat dripping into your mouth as you try rescuing yourself from diabolical traps. Feel the torturous strain on every muscle as you wield again and again sacred weapon power-ups such as Holy Water, the Battle Axe, the Crystal Blade Boomerang and the Mirror of Truth. But in the end, make sure you've saved enough strength to scream!</summary>

      <review>this game I feel is the weakest out of the 3. That isn't to say this game is bad</review>

      <review>it doesn't even come close to touching rondo of bloods OST. All in all</review>

    <summary>Final Fantasy V is a fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by Square in 1992 as a part of the Final Fantasy series. The game first appeared only in Japan on Nintendo's Super Famicom (known internationally as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System). It has been ported with minor differences to Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. An original video animation produced in 1994 called FINAL FANTASY: Legend of the Crystals serves as a sequel to the events depicted in the game. It was released for the PlayStation Network on April 6, 2011, in Japan. An enhanced port of the game, with new high-resolution graphics and a touch-based interface, was released for iPhone and iPad on March 28, 2013, and for Android on September 25, 2013. FINAL FANTASY V has been praised for the freedom of customization that the player has over the characters, achieved through the greatly expanded Job System. Despite being released only in Japan, the Super Famicom version sold more than two million copies. The PlayStation version has earned "Greatest Hits" status, selling more than 350,000 copies.</summary>

    <summary>Jet Set Radio Future is a video game developed by Smilebit and is the sequel to Jet Set Radio. Similar to the original, it depicts a future Tokyo where freedom of expression is outlawed. The user plays a character in the GG's, a gang of in-line skating graffiti artists who skate around Tokyo covering up rival gangs' graffiti, knocking over Rokkaku police, and dancing to the electric soundtrack. The game uses a cel-shaded style of animation, and has been widely acclaimed for its unique music style, detailed art, and gameplay. Though the game is set in the future, its style and content incorporates many aspects of 1980's old school hip hop culture, as well as 1990's J-pop culture.</summary>

      <review>luring players in with it's phenomenal vibes only to trap them in a game with floaty controls and a jank camera. This game does not have that problem. Compared to the first game</review>
      <review>the controls are a lot tighter and the camera doesn't nearly have as many issues. That being said</review>
      <review>this isn't a whole improvement over the first game</review>
      <review>as the level structure for this game is more wide and open ended</review>
      <review>leading to level design that isn't as polished IMO. Lots of tall vertical shafts you have to precariously climb up where one wrong move sends you all the way back down</review>
      <review>and stuff like that gets kinda tedious after a while. Aesthetically it is on par with the original game</review>
      <review>though I will say the licensed half of the soundtrack is weaker here than it was in game 1. This is definitely the most modern feeling JSR so it's an actual crime that this game has never been rereleased in the over 20 years since it has came out as of me writing this review. Wasn't even put on backwards compatibility for the newest xboxes</review>

      <review>story and gameplay</review>
      <review>it's all so perfectly crafted that I cannot believe not many people has played it yet.\n \n Sigurd is one of the best lords (if not the best lord in the series)</review>
      <review>his whole journey and how it ends is amazing</review>
      <review>I love it so much.\n \n Played a ranked run but got a mediocre B Rank</review>
      <review>still had tons of fun and I would play it again"</review>
      <review>"Genealogy of the Holy War\n \n is almost less of a game and more like a story that you interact with. If it wasn’t for the near unrivaled mix of worldbuilding with gameplay I would not like\n \n FE4\n \n as much as I did. Despite birthing some elements that would be integral to Fire Emblem as a franchise going forward</review>
      <review>it’s also the most unique entry in the series by far. Even with all of its influence and acclaim</review>
      <review>not ONE game past this has ever tried replicating everything this game did. Some of that could be attributed to the new systems being seen more as flaws rather than benefits</review>
      <review>or the sheer complexity maybe too scary for newer players. I’m not sure.\n \n I finished this game over a week ago</review>
      <review>and I’ve been banging my head on the wall trying to figure out what to say. I feel like I need to get the word out of what this game is</review>
      <review>but it’s just not fully coming to me. I’d love to write a review as long as a single enemy phase in this game but I really can’t do that as much as I try. So I’ll suffice by writing something shorter while explaining why YOU should at least experience this game once.\n \n War. Legacy. Succession. Betrayal. Tragedy. These are all themes that\n \n Genealogy of the Holy War\n \n focuses on. Fire Emblem has.. well obviously always been about war. However\n \n Genealogy\n \n</review>
      <review>out of all the games I’ve experienced</review>
      <review>delves the most into the pure tragedy and unfairness of what war is. There are so many moments where you just.. can’t save everyone. The other games have similar moments</review>
      <review>but this one melds it into the gameplay so perfectly and precisely. Every map is vast with history</review>
      <review>communities</review>
      <review>and density. They genuinely do feel like actual locales rather than “a video game level”. That goes both to its benefit and detriment from a gameplay perspective</review>
      <review>but from a\n \n story\n \n perspective</review>
      <review>it’s pure bliss. We follow our heroes through lush forests</review>
      <review>sprawling plains</review>
      <review>harsh mountains</review>
      <review>scorching deserts etc. You slowly proceed through this seemingly endless war</review>
      <review>each map becoming more and more hopeless.\n \n I should also preface that you need to experience this story blind. I know it’s very hard to do as such with how much the middle plot twist is spoiled to everyone</review>
      <review>but I encourage you to stay as blind as possible.\n \n Genealogy’s\n \n narrative is fantastic</review>
      <review>not only for a Fire Emblem game but for a piece of media in general. Seliph is one of my favorite video game characters of all time because of how we follow his journey from suffering a harsh young life</review>
      <review>but growing to become a fine young man himself capable of what his mission is. Once again</review>
      <review>I’m not going to elaborate so the reader can find out what happens themselves</review>
      <review>but the story is</review>
      <review>no exaggeration</review>
      <review>simply masterful.\n \n Generational storytelling is one of my favorite tropes of all time. Seeing how descendants of a generation will remedy the mistakes</review>
      <review>regrets</review>
      <review>or failures of their predecessors has always been so engaging to me. While\n \n Genealogy's\n \n latter half isn't nearly as narratively complex as the former half</review>
      <review>it's story about the next generation of heroes is among one of my favorites for this trope. Ily Seliph.\n \n Presentation also goes a long way</review>
      <review>of course. Every music track in the game adds to the atmosphere so heavily</review>
      <review>it’s easily one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard on the Super Famicom. Some tracks were so masterfully composed I nearly shed tears</review>
      <review>I couldn’t believe how well it played me especially when I can rarely cry at soundtracks anymore. The graphics can be hit or miss</review>
      <review>especially with the character portraits</review>
      <review>but the maps and environments are top notch. I could really look at them for so long.\n \n I think that’s pretty much all I could think of to say about\n \n Genealogy of the Holy War\n \n . As a game… it’s a mess. Possibly even objectively bad. But as a story</review>
      <review>a piece of artistry… it’s an undeniable masterpiece. It’s certainly not for everyone</review>
      <review>I’m aware</review>
      <review>but it is worth experiencing in full at LEAST once. Not my favorite Fire Emblem because of the gameplay</review>
      <review>but definitely the best narrative and cast of characters in my eyes.\n \n Also ever notice how so many of the people who say this game sucks (or other classic FE games for that matter) are Three Houses fans or have Three Houses pfps? curious …."</review>
      <review>"A great game</review>
      <review>and my favorite of the Fire Emblem Franchise. The game is kind of easy for a Fire Emblem game</review>
      <review>and it's clearly not the best tactical experience you'll get in this franchie. This game is more a playable story than it is a game with a good story in it. Every element of Genealogy serves the narrative</review>
      <review>the strenght of the characters reflects their developpement and their place in the world</review>
      <review>the challenges are constantly evolving to flow with the story</review>
      <review>story events that you can't even participate in take place during fights... This allow the universe to feel real</review>
      <review>and we can feel the stakes of what's happening. It's clearly not a game for everyone</review>
      <review>it can be slow and tedious at times</review>
      <review>and the story can be less interesting in the second half</review>
      <review>but if you think a game using his mecanics mainly to tell a compelling plot with memorable characters may be for you</review>
      <review>I'll blindy recommand that you at least give it a try. Don't be afraid of the difficulty if you're not used to play old Fire Emblem games</review>
      <review>you can save litteraly every turn</review>
      <review>and you have broken characters among your units."]</review>

    <summary>When a demon's castle darkens the land, two sisters challenge its halls. Together they can break the curse. Players take control of the two sisters with different attacks and capabilities to challenge the demon castle and the bosses waiting within. Discover new routes through the castle using the sisters' unique abilities! The stars of Grim Guardians are the long-distance focused "Shinobu Kamizono" and the close-range brawler "Maya Kamizono." Players will need to consider the situation when choosing which sister to control as they make their way through the castle, investigating the mystery of what happened to their school and its students. Other features include 2-player co-op with special actions, extensive difficulty options with the "Style System," unique changes on repeat plays, and most importantly the quality and challenge players have come to expect from Inti Creates titles, this time with a new gothic horror aesthetic.</summary>

      <review>["I thought the game was fun but it was all right it started out pretty well but the second half of the game kinda overstayed it's welcome. It's gotten me more interested in trying more of Castlevania though"</review>
      <review>"An alright game. I think co-op is the best way to go here--that's how I played it. The level design and enemies could be a bit generic (and sometimes annoying)</review>
      <review>and it definitely suffers from a bit of padding; still</review>
      <review>it isn't trying to be anything more than a cute Castlevania homage/parody. Shinobu and Maya are fun to play as but don't reach their full potential until their full movesets are unlocked. My friend and I both agreed if they changed some stuff about this game structurally</review>
      <review>it would be a bit better. I definitely had more fun once we could do everything. Play if you want a short</review>
      <review>but decent couple of hours of action-platforming with a friend."</review>
      <review>"This was a pretty solid Metroidvania</review>
      <review>but the game just kept getting better for me as I got deeper into the second half. It's charming and funny. I was sold after seeing a girl with an uzi</review>
      <review>and there are even more ridiculous and cool weapons to unlock. I really dug it. Great Metoidvania with some good boss fights."</review>
      <review>"Good game overall! Probably the best grappling hook to ever exist in a 2D game</review>
      <review>but doing 100% completion was absolute hell. I'm not sure why Inti insisted on having no good map system considering how many collectibles there are</review>

      <review>which require precise and deliberate maneuvers to make it through various do-or-die scenarios. The gameplay here just isn't busy or demanding enough. With that being said</review>
      <review>it was at least engaging enough to justify the mandatory second playthrough to get the ending</review>
      <review>owed in part to the myriad of new paths unlocked in each level and the plethora of secrets to discover."</review>
      <review>"A solid castlevania game with fun co-op integration</review>
      <review>unfortunately brought down by the developer's insistence on forcing repeat playthroughs with minor differences to pad playtime and boss fights that are largely a joke. Also while I do find the gal gun girls cute</review>

      <review>often through their unpolished state: this game feels very clunky. I do quite like the weapons</review>

      <review>"Good souls-like game. The bosses</review>
      <review>level design and combat feel very similar to FromSoft games so if you're into those give this game a shot. It's perfect lengh at around 10-12 hours and it also tries to do it's own thing so it won't feel like playing just a worse Dark Souls game."]</review>

    <summary>Live A Live's story is split across seven seemingly unrelated chapters that can be played in any order, based on popular genres such as Western, science fiction, and mecha. Each chapter has its own plot, setting, and characters. Although the basic gameplay is the same throughout the game, each chapter adds a new factor to the basic formula, such as the stealth elements in the ninja chapter. After the first seven chapters are completed, two final chapters take place to establish the connection between the seven previous and resolve the story.</summary>

      <review>capped off with a final route that manages to tie all its other routes together and deliver its own beautiful story. And all this was done in a 90s JRPG released on the Super Famicom.

    <summary>Resident Evil 4: Ultimate HD Edition is the second port of Resident Evil 4 to Windows, this time based on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions with updated graphics. In contrast to the original port, this version features lighting effects, real-time instead of rendered cutscenes (except in the Separate Ways campaign), mouse support and Steamworks integration. This version features all previously seen additional content, including the achievements from the latest HD Console versions. The game can be played with SD and HD quality textures, a filter option and an FPS lock option was also added allowing the user to select from 30 or 60 FPS options.</summary>

      <review>["It's weird to think that Resident Evil 4 would work</review>
      <review>let alone be considered a competing best entry game in the franchise along with REmake. It practically reinvents everything the franchise was known for</review>
      <review>removing all signs of survival horror for a more action focused game. Puzzles are few and far between. Linearity is more pronounced now</review>
      <review>with things like weapons no longer being found on the map</review>
      <review>but bought from a merchant</review>
      <review>along with weapon upgrades. The game even lacks zombies of all things</review>
      <review>at least in the usual sense. It even adds elements that people just dislike about gaming in general - half the game is essentially an escort mission</review>
      <review>and quick time events are everywhere."</review>
      <review>"Played for the first time using the HD project. Looked amazing despite some hiccups here and there. Even though this is one of my favorite games and I have played through it dozens of times over the years</review>
      <review>it definitely shows it's age in some areas. Going back to this from the Remake demo really hammers home how bad the AI is in this game and the QTEs get old</review>
      <review>especially on the Island. Speaking of</review>
      <review>by the time I got here I was ready to be done. Outside of the Regenerators the Island just isn't that interesting compared to what came before and it's repetitive to boot."</review>

      <review>muito bom. Sim</review>
      <review>as QTE's com morte instantânea são um produto do seu tempo</review>

If Agent 47 must stay hidden, make clean ‘hits’ and leave the scene unnoticed, he will be rewarded. But if he is revealed during a violent act, his picture will end up in the papers and on wanted posters, making the job as a contract killer more difficult. This time, Agent 47 is paid in cold, hard cash. How the money is spent will affect his passage through the game and the weapons at his disposal, resulting in a unique game-play experience for each player.</summary>

    <summary>As with previous Professor Layton games, Unwound Future is an adventure game where the player solves puzzles offered by local citizens to progress the story forward, through dialogue and around 32 minutes of full motion video. The player moves about the game through still images of locations. The player can use the DS touchscreen to tap on non-player characters to start a dialog or to obtain a puzzle, and also can search anywhere on the background for hint coins, with some areas needing to be tapped several times to reveal a secret hint coin or puzzle. Puzzles are brainteasers of many varieties, including visual, math, and logic. There is no time limit to solve puzzles, and the player can get up to 3 hints at a cost of one hint coin each; a new feature in Unwound Future is a "super hint", costing 2 coins, that can only be bought after the other 3 hints have been revealed, but that nearly reveals the puzzle's solution. If the player is correct in solving the puzzle, they gain a number of "Picarats", a form of currency within the game. Guessing the incorrect answer will reduce the number of picarats the player can get on subsequent attempts. Players can visit certain areas in order to play undiscovered or unsolved puzzles that are left behind as the story progresses.</summary>

      <review>you find yourself saying "Lets go zip vines are back" rather than losing interest because they are so fun and implemented so expertly. They decided to skip the pleasantries of making a boring world one boss and just make every boss in this game great</review>

Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 takes place between Chapters 5 and 6 of the previous game, Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu. Several characters from Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu appear, such as Leaf, Fin, and Nanna. It takes place in the Thracian peninsula in southeastern Jugdral.</summary>

      <review>["There's genuinely nothing funny I could say about Thracia</review>
      <review>or anything that hasn't already been said about it that would do it justice. There's no other FE game that matches its raw gameplay integrity and absolutely genius ideas</review>
      <review>with Genealogy at least coming in close second. For every bullshit thing the game throws at you</review>
      <review>the game gives you quadruple the amount of bullshit to use against the enemy - like there are so many brave and master weapons and staves that basically get handed to you on a silver platter</review>
      <review>and while there are a few chapters that are trial and error</review>
      <review>actually figuring them out genuinely feels so good - no other Fire Emblem game gives me this much dopamine. Hell</review>
      <review>I made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game</review>
      <review>going in depth on every strategy I utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play. I think it's worth mentioning that this is the first time a game has compelled me to do something like this."</review>

      <review>'Oh my God. I can’t believe I slept on this game/ kept it for last thinking it would be too hard for me. Despite being on the SNES</review>
      <review>it’s an absolute masterpiece of a game</review>

      <review>being the final SNES game ever made</review>
      <review>released in 1999</review>
      <review>nine years after the SNES’s inception</review>
      <review>and 3 years into the N64’s lifespan. Shouzou Kaga was evidently opposed to making a Fire Emblem game on the N64</review>
      <review>believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters</review>
      <review>and that philosophy to keep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1’s Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles. That too went well</review>
      <review>but let’s focus on FE5.'</review>
      <review>'This game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it</review>
      <review>the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half</review>
      <review>but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful</review>
      <review>to say the least. Still</review>
      <review>after strategizing for hours</review>
      <review>constantly saving and loading states and rage moments</review>
      <review>sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remarkable\n \n Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it. While FE4 had it\'s fair share of dark moments</review>
      <review>this game is straight up depressing</review>
      <review>you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. By the beggining of the game</review>
      <review>you feel completely lost</review>
      <review>and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty</review>
      <review>just like Leif</review>
      <review>feeling lost on this brutal war. You are not a group of experienced and heroic knights</review>
      <review>leading for victory</review>
      <review>you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire</review>
      <review>and you\'re obviously going to get obliterated against such force. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units</review>
      <review>a hope slowly rises</review>
      <review>and you go from "how the hell am i going to survive from this?" to "Hey</review>
      <review>i can actually do this!" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. And then</review>
      <review>you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire. It\'s actually even harder then before</review>
      <review>but you have so much more experince with the game</review>
      <review>you don\'t feel as powerless as before. And after you\'ve gone through so much</review>
      <review>beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n \n This</review>
      <review>is phenomenal storytelling</review>
      <review>and you can only have this in a videogame</review>
      <review>that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. That\'s why remake of this game is probably going to suck</review>
      <review>since they\'ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.\n \n Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management</review>
      <review>and i love this</review>
      <review>you can capture enemies to steal their equipment</review>
      <review>but it\'s significantly harder and risky to do</review>
      <review>since you\'ll deal much less and take much more damage. But since you don\'t get much chance to buy and repair weapons</review>
      <review>you really have to pay attention the resources you have</review>
      <review>and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n \n Fatigue is also a new mechanic</review>
      <review>which if you use a unit too much</review>
      <review>you won\'t be able to use them in the next chapter</review>
      <review>which makes powerful units more tricky to use</review>
      <review>adding another depth to the gameplay. You\'ll only want to use them when necessary</review>
      <review>so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units</review>
      <review>i gotta say this was hard to get used to</review>
      <review>especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4</review>
      <review>but it didn\'t took long to for me to actually like it\n \n Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller</review>
      <review>but focused maps with multiple objectives</review>
      <review>and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. You have defense</review>
      <review>escape</review>
      <review>fog of war(which isn\'t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. Also each map has it\'s own unique objective</review>
      <review>which makes every single map even more memorable. Varied objectives makes each chapter fresh</review>
      <review>which is something i\'ve never seen in an SRPG\n \n Weakest part of this game imo are the characters</review>
      <review>in FE4</review>
      <review>you have a lot of optional conversations between characters</review>
      <review>and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit</review>
      <review>in FE5</review>
      <review>most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most</review>
      <review>and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.\n \n But i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n \n Though this doesn\'t mean that this game has no good character writing</review>
      <review>far from it</review>
      <review>Leif is one the best written main character\'s i\'ve ever seen in a game. Like i mentioned before</review>
      <review>you start of the game as powerless</review>
      <review>and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. Just like Leif</review>
      <review>who\'s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. This is obviously no coincidence</review>
      <review>Leif represents the player</review>
      <review>but unlike most games that have a main character which is"representing the player"Leif isn\'t a silent protagonist</review>
      <review>his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural</review>
      <review>and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player</review>
      <review>as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n \n I\'m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4</review>
      <review>but still</review>
      <review>this is one the finest SRPG\'s ever made. It\'s frusturating for sure</review>
      <review>but it\'s so well designed in nearly every aspect</review>
      <review>it\'s impossible for me to hate it. I\'d highly recommend it if you liked FE4</review>
      <review>and simply want to see more from this world.']</review>

    <reviews>
      <review>['The premise is interesting</review>
      <review>but the combat hamstrings it for me. Dungeon roguelites must have enjoyable combat.'</review>
      <review>"A small-time shopkeeper moonlighting (he said the thing!) as a warrior fighting through ancient dungeons in search of shinies to sell is a neat idea on paper. The shop management part of the game is executed well enough. Combat is so horrid it made me drop the game entirely.

      <review>'че-то не понравилось</review>
      <review>как-то запарно и в то же время неинтересно. Топорный рогалик с данжами</review>

      <review>['Removing the underground dungeons and not adding anything interesting to the gameplay makes it the worst pikmin game but it is still decent. They did add 3 playable characters at once but that level of micromanaging was more of annoying the\n \n Interesting.

      <review>'Actually the best Pikmin game. Period. It takes the best parts of the last two games: rich colorful environments brimming with personality</review>

    <summary>This time, the terror has followed you home. In this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows. Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you. You have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end.</summary>

      <review>"while the additional routes does make the game a lot better and more realized</review>
      <review>it doesn't change my whole opinion on it that most of my problems are still there</review>
      <review>sure some of them are gone but the additional routes also makes more issues such as the pacing of each routes ranges from decent to abysmal</review>
      <review>though i can't deny the fact that this is a much better version than og Chaos Head</review>
      <review>also make sure to play the CoZ patch it's a lot more consistent and it's better in general."</review>
      <review>'The original Chaos;Head is a flawed</review>

      <review>but for me at least</review>

      <review>along with what they add to the gameplay experience overall</review>
      <review>helps give a sense of thematic finality</review>
      <review>if that makes sense. Chaos;Head is a great start to the Science Adventure series</review>

The NieR: Automata - The End of YoRHa Edition includes the game itself and comes packed with DLC and bonus content for the full experience of the award-winning post-apocalyptic action RPG.</summary>

      <review>['I have no words</review>
      <review>honestly. Peak'</review>
      <review>'Assim como sua "prequel"</review>
      <review>Nier: Automata é um jogo quase que impecável. Um dos seus pontos mais fortes com certeza é a sua lore espetacular acompanhada de personagens envolventes e muito bem desenvolvidos conforme o desenrolar da trama. Além de ter uma estética incrível e uma gameplay divertida e diversificada.\n \n Apesar do jogo ter a mesma problemática em relação ao design de personagens femininas</review>
      <review>a parte em que o jogo peca profundamente é o sistema de Levels. Claramente dá pra ver que essa mecânica é extremamente desbalanceada e sem sentido pro jogo</review>
      <review>ou você é muito fraco ou você é extremamente forte em comparação á TODOS os inimigos</review>
      <review>o jogo não tem um scaling para os inimigos acompanharem o seu progresso nos levels</review>
      <review>deixando uma discrepância grave d poder na maioria das vezes.\n \n Porém</review>
      <review>mesmo assim</review>
      <review>sinto que o jogo não mereça uma nota menor do que 10</review>
      <review>as partes que o jogo peca são fortes sim</review>
      <review>mas não o bastante para ofuscar a enorme "masterpiece" que é Nier: Automata. Termino minha análise convicto que este jogo definitivamente é um "must-play" para quem aprecia videogames num geral.'</review>
      <review>"I like to think that YoRHa stands for Yoko's Robot Harem"</review>
      <review>'Vdd'</review>
      <review>"I'll start by saying I love Automata</review>
      <review>truthfully; NieR happens to be one of my favorite franchises and one that I'm really</review>
      <review>really well versed and invested in the lore of. Those games have made me laugh</review>
      <review>cry and suffer with the characters more times than I can say</review>
      <review>and that's possibly even more the case with Automata. This port</review>
      <review>however</review>
      <review>was absolute hot garbage; it was done dirty and needed absolutely to be done better for the fans of the series who shelled out\n \n more\n \n money for a game they'd potentially purchased one or more times. That said</review>
      <review>I'll itemize why this port was terrible:"</review>
      <review>'+ scifi story at its best\n \n + characters you get attached to\n \n + the music and its variants and the times it is cued to play\n \n + hacking and how it is integrated into the story/whenever the UI itself is messed up\n \n + difficulty settings</review>
      <review>being able to pick and choose from the auto chips\n \n - targeting hacking and bullets can be wacky when there are multiple enemies</review>
      <review>literally makes it harder having auto chips on\n \n - more quests and things to do would have been nice but the ones that are there are alright']</review>

      <review>similar to the ant farm like layout from games like XCOM. I enjoyed the majority of my playthrough as it was something different for me to play and compared to the fallout I'm used to. There are microtransactions</review>

      <review>but it's definitely a lot less greedy here as they don't shove it in your face every five minutes. I played 67 hours of this</review>
      <review>got my platinum and I never spend a single cent on Microtransactions or felt I had to</review>
      <review>as the game gives you lootboxes at a good rate from just natural gameplay. In the end</review>
      <review>the game did ware on me a bit towards the end</review>

    <summary>Sonic and the Secret Rings is a three-dimensional platform and action game featuring an on-rails style of movement. Sonic the Hedgehog, the series' main character, is the game's only player character. He is controlled exclusively with the Wii Remote, which is held horizontally like a traditional gamepad.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["This has one of the STUPIDEST game design choices I've ever seen. Having to BUY good controls doesn't make for a fun experience</review>
      <review>it just becomes frustrating. The only thing I can maybe praise is the OST. That aside</review>
      <review>this game is not worth it."</review>
      <review>"This game is very easy not to like. It has one of the craziest motion control mechanics grazed on a platformer and Sonic's movement at the beginning course of the game is not great. Slow acceleration</review>
      <review>slow jumps</review>
      <review>and over sensitive maneuvering becomes intially apparent and it doesn't help that you have to slowly keep unlocking better maneuvering mechanics as well as other beneficial abilities that you won't get until at least midgame unless you decide to replay levels over and over and over</review>
      <review>or grind out through exciting filler stages like clear this stage with 0 rings and kill 1 enemy etc."</review>
      <review>"This game ain't it. The plot is okay and the game looks decent and sounds great</review>
      <review>but the controls are so bad the whole thing is barely playable. Theres a lot of emphasis on motion controls with the wii remote and they want you to be precise with em when the controls themselves are as imprecise as possible. Kinda like super monkey ball banana blitz except at least that game felt like the levels were designed around the new control scheme to a degree. Instead of doing regular levels in a linear order like literally every sonic game before it</review>
      <review>this game has you do a bunch of scattered mini-objectives in order to progress</review>
      <review>except even then its not entirely obvious which ones you need to do to actually proceed. The vibes are on point for sure</review>
      <review>but it's not really a game I'd want to go back to. Even kid me didn't like this one."</review>

Players begin the game by setting out to live life on their own in a colorful town, where they are greeted by a seemingly endless supply of things to do and characters to meet. Time passes in Animal Crossing in real-time, as the month, day, season, and time of day matches that of the player's. Holiday seasons come and go in Animal Crossing, just as they would in the real world. Experience the freedom to fish, decorate your house, go bug catching, garden, write letters, and even play original Nintendo NES games in this imaginative, and addictive game.</summary>

Take control of one of four characters that can be interchanged at any time during gameplay: The sword-swinging exorcist Zangetsu, the whip-wielding heroine Miriam, the magic using alchemist Alfred, and Gebel, who can turn into a bat and take to the skies. Finally, you can experience multiple endings depending on how you interact with the characters you meet. This project is the 8-bit style game promised as a stretch goal of the 2015 Kickstarter campaign for "Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night." Backers of the Kickstarter campaign are encouraged to check the Kickstarter page for updates.</summary>

      <review>["Oh boy. Playing the XIII series is looking more and more like a mistake. It's...fine? It's not as linear as XIII which makes it a little more fun but by the final stretch</review>
      <review>I'm just tired. The combat isn't enough to hold up the story which seems needlessly convoluted and doesn't feel like it's really going anywhere. Maybe I'm missing something cause about halfway through I started to zone out when the characters started talking. So yeah</review>
      <review>it's okay. The ending (which I watched) makes the game seem a little pointless.\n \n Overall</review>
      <review>it's fine I guess. I'm done."</review>
      <review>'So like XIII I also platinumed XIII-2.'</review>
      <review>'a marked improvement over 13-1 with alot more things to do and sights to see. exploration has been improved drastically with there actually being shit to do other than fight! wow! seeing a bunch of locations from the first game in different time periods and seeing how they begin</review>
      <review>and end is a great feature and an interesting way to justify reuse of assets. the characters were interesting to me</review>
      <review>and I was really hoping noel would get to see Yeul again. at the same time Caius has a great motivation and I kind of wanted him to win too! the combat system here is one of my favorites in the series. being able to use monsters as your third-party member allows for tons of variety. the plot can get pretty confusing at times however and the ending was wildly unsatisfying. but all in all it might just be my favorite in the trilogy'</review>
      <review>"shouldn't have smoked that shit now i'm in oerba 300 -AF-"</review>
      <review>'Gets an extra half-star for nostalgic reasons.\n \n Very conflicted on this game. It was not needed and if you learn more about how they had plans for multiple games as part of the "crystallis" collection then you start to connect the dots as to how we ended up with a game with so much potential. If you were to have a new cast of characters to play with but in the same world as FF13 it would make more sense and not trash the original. You could still have characters from the original game show up as NPCs. This helps connect the worlds. But Serah and Lightning could\'ve been replaced.'</review>
      <review>"my stars are because of nostalgia about the time i played this</review>

    <summary>Agar.io is a Massively-multiplayer top-down strategy browser game. In Agar.io, the player manipulates a circular cell using the mouse and keyboard buttons. The goal of the game is to enlarge the cell by swallowing non-player cells which are randomly scattered around the map. Other players that have smaller cells than the player are also able to be swallowed. Originally a browser game, Agar.io entered Steam Greenlight and was subsequently "Greenlit" by the community, with the developers indicating that they planned to add more features not available in the web version of the game. Agar.io has quickly become popular worldwide. Before the Turkish 2015 elections, Agar.io has been used in Turkey for political reasons; some political parties have also used Agar.io in campaign posters as a symbol of support. Players can also use skins.</summary>

      <review>['Pretty cool albeit a bit similar to the first game. Still got them cult shenanigans. The plot was definitely more interesting this time around since its about twins getting involved with the aforementioned cult shenanigans. The combat is a bit better than the first but still can be a bit annoying with ghosts clipping through walls n such. The game is also separated into a bunch of smaller mansions rather than one big mansion. If you liked the first one you cant do wrong here either.'</review>

      <review>['This game is so drawn out</review>
      <review>even basic camera pans take way too long. And I played in turbo mode! I did not feel like my time was being respected</review>
      <review>so I quit partway through.'</review>
      <review>'A really good game with a few problems</review>
      <review>nevertheless still a good game. I really loved the way the end of cold steel 1 led to cold steel 2. This is also the game where lore really starts to kick in motion a little which also later develops even more in future games. I loved how both cold steel 1 and 2 happen at the same time as zero and azure since during zero and azure</review>
      <review>I would always be wondering what is happening in erebonia with all the small news and such that we get. The ending to cold steel 2 was amazing. It really was something that I was not expecting.'</review>
      <review>'Solid follow up'</review>
      <review>'In my opinion</review>
      <review>the weakest game in the series currently. The pacing on the first half of the game is very bad</review>
      <review>but gets very good eventually!'</review>
      <review>"What a fuckin snoozefest of a game. After Cold Steel 1 took its time setting things up I expected Cold Steel 2 to deliver on its storyline and show us the civil war first mentioned in Trails to Azure. Instead</review>
      <review>the game hardly shows any of the actual civil war and has you do a lot of miscellaneous things that don't really matter too much in the grand scheme of things. Crow's death at the end of the (second to) last dungeon was the only moment that made me feel anything. Then rather than end on what seemed like should've been the ending</review>
      <review>you start playing as thr protagonist from the previous arc and get to beat up this game's protagonist</review>
      <review>which was admittedly cathartic in a way. Then the game temporarily goes back to the structure of cold steel 1 to show the characters back in their school life before throwing in a 25 floor</review>
      <review>randomly generated dungeon at the last minute. This is seemingly a contrived way of having the game end on a high note even though they accomplish nothing by doing it."</review>

After each missions, you are payed in full. The money raised can then go on towards the purchase of items for your mech. Weapon upgrades, better shields, even the opportunity to purchase what's called an Exceed Orbit, smaller robot gun emplacements that hover around your mech, giving you an added boost of fire power in the crunch. 4 player deathmatch modes are also included, where you each pit your supped-up mechs against each other to see who is the last robot standing.</summary>

    <summary>The Star Wars Saga continues with Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, the highly anticipated sequel to the fastest-selling Star Wars game ever created, which has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, the world was introduced to Darth Vader’s now fugitive apprentice, Starkiller — the unlikely hero who would ignite the flames of rebellion in a galaxy so desperately in need of a champion. In the sequel, Starkiller returns with over-the-top Force powers and embarks on a journey to discover his own identity and to reunite with his one true love, Juno Eclipse. In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, Starkiller is once again the pawn of Darth Vader — but instead of training his protégée as a ruthless assassin, the dark lord is attempting to clone his former apprentice in an attempt to create the Ultimate Sith warrior. The chase is on — Starkiller is in pursuit of Juno and Darth Vader is hunting for Starkiller. With all-new devastating Force powers and the ability to dual-wield lightsabers, Starkiller cuts a swath through deadly new enemies across exciting worlds from the Star Wars movies — all in his desperate search for answers to his past.</summary>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the first 3D open-world game in the Zelda series. Link can travel anywhere and be equipped with weapons and armor found throughout the world to grant him various bonuses. Unlike many games in the series, Breath of the Wild does not impose a specific order in which quests or dungeons must be completed. While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method. A lot of critics ranked Breath of the Wild as one of the best video games of all time.</summary>

      <review>with its amazing soundtrack and gorgeous art direction it really makes you feel like you're spiderman. one of the best value in gaming tbh</review>
      <review>this game is packed full of content and none of it feels like filler. even the boss rush manages to feel fresh by introducing some surprise bosses/boss variants as rewards for beating tough pantheons. cant wait to play silksong when i turn 80!"</review>

      <review>now I'm seeking for similar adventures and I can't wait for Silksong.\n \n I've done all 112% in my first run and now I'm beating the game again</review>

      <review>exploration</review>

      <review>it\'s slightly better that the sum of its parts. Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful</review>

      <review>reminiscent of Wiley\'s fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized</review>
      <review>were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as "not my style" to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n \n -The repeated backtracking. I get it - a fast-travel mechanic that\'s too liberal can erase the environment</review>
      <review>but this was excessive.\n \n -Some of the charms seemed worthless</review>
      <review>even after strategizing for boss</review>
      <review>combat</review>
      <review>and platforming rushes.\n \n -In the name of decency and civility</review>

    <summary>Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with, and modify a dynamically-generated map made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.</summary>

      <review>fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid-battle\n \n -The lack of freedom to do what you want\n \n -Similar to SMT IV/IV:A (and maybe other SMT/Persona games</review>
      <review>idk) they sell DLC for super powerful personas. In SMTIV at least</review>
      <review>these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal</review>
      <review>they included the DLC</review>
      <review>which again</review>
      <review>I could ignore if they are optional</review>
      <review>but I can't. Unlike in pervious games</review>
      <review>there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally</review>

      <review>I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game</review>
      <review>although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something</review>
      <review>like 5-10 hours more</review>
      <review>and something incredible would happen for sure</review>

      <review>and of course the lack of meaningful presentation through stiff character animations and lack of voice acting hurt this game alot.

      <review>["Not my fav XB game</review>
      <review>I didn't grow attached to the cast in general and overall I felt that the game always wanted to show me how great it was compared to the others- which I didn't like."</review>
      <review>'I love this video game'</review>
      <review>"Most of the content I consume doesn't affect me emotionally</review>
      <review>but even I experienced an emotional damage from Xenoblade Chronicles 3 because its world was so depressive and the musics were supporting that depressive atmosphere. Thanks to Tetsuya Takahashi's great storytelling</review>
      <review>I found myself caring about the characters</review>
      <review>the story</review>
      <review>and of course</review>
      <review>the world."</review>
      <review>'Woah'</review>
      <review>'This certainly was a long game. For context i have played xenoblade 1dx and seen 2 on youtube</review>
      <review>so i will mostly probobly be comparing it to xenoblade 1. The concept is immedietly quite interesting</review>
      <review>although'</review>
      <review>"hmmmmmmm. Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters</review>
      <review>the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didn't add to much</review>
      <review>if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect</review>
      <review>this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke</review>
      <review>with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though</review>
      <review>it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game</review>
      <review>which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games</review>
      <review>and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series</review>
      <review>but this definitely didn't hit as much as the first or even the second game to me. Still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh..."]</review>

      <review>['Kirby and the Forgotten Land is one of the harder games for me to rate. The reason for this is what I think of the game vs my own personal feelings with the game.'</review>
      <review>'Keep making games like this Hal'</review>
      <review>'Incredible jump to 3D for the Kirby games while still managing to feel like a classic Kirby title. The game makes amazing use of 3D environments to add a new layer of exploration and creativity to every single level</review>
      <review>and I had a lot of fun clearing the main and extra stories with all bonus challenges. While the main content is easy and very chill</review>
      <review>bonus optional content can be very tricky. Only thing I disliked were a few difficulty spikes in some side objectives and the lack of a "restart from checkpoint" button but</review>
      <review>overall</review>
      <review>this is a masterful game that makes the most out of its simplicity as a Kirby game</review>
      <review>but this time you can swallow a whole car and spit it unharmed.'</review>
      <review>"kirby and the ermmmmm??? GOAT???\n \n if future kirby games are like this</review>
      <review>i totally wouldn't mind that. the gameplay is quite honestly an upgrade to the original formula. the bosses quite specifically</review>
      <review>are the most fun fights i've had in quite a while. great stuff</review>
      <review>right here"</review>
      <review>'Perhaps the best Kirby game since 64 and Roboplanet</review>
      <review>with great ability upgrades</review>
      <review>inventive levels</review>
      <review>great bosses</review>
      <review>and</review>
      <review>of course</review>
      <review>a thick layer of cute smothered all over every aspect.'</review>
      <review>'Replayed with the kids. The later levels and the treasure road portals make great use of every power. The hidden waddle dees push you to explore</review>
      <review>sure</review>
      <review>but also demand perfection for a few bosses. And the forgotten islands prove the developers knew exactly what they were doing - a few enemies get additional move sets that expertly increase the pressure. If anything</review>
      <review>I wanted a dodge move to help me out some more.\n \n I kept Easy on the entire play through and barely scraped by the back part of the game. Yet it’s always changing enemy and levels up enough that it never feels repetitive. If anything</review>
      <review>I was left wanting just a taste more.\n \n Overall</review>
      <review>a great Kirby game and a great video game.']</review>

      <review>which is never a good sign. This was my second attempt at finishing the game and I actually got a lot further than on my first one. I might pick this up again sometime in the future</review>
      <review>but I don't think this game is for me."</review>
      <review>'Still unsure whether I like the ending or not and for a game with some of the best worldbuilding I’ve ever seen I wish more of the game had to do with that world - but at the end of the day it’s still the best writing any game has ever had so can’t be too mad'</review>
      <review>"I was very scared of playing this because I knew it has a lot of text and a crazy big skill tree.\n \n First day ingame was horrible</review>
      <review>I kept making bad decisions and throws and even got a game-over. Also the game talks about politics in a deep and serious way so I kinda felt like a kid in an adult game haha. I honestly thought I would just abandonned it but at the end of the day there's this discussion you have with Kitsuragi and he's being very nice and comprehensive and it put me in a good mood; So I just decided to go with the fact that I'm playing a pretty bad cop and continue with the game.\n \n In the end I really liked it</review>
      <review>beautiful art direction and visuals</review>
      <review>I loved discovering more about the world. Tho I still probably didn't really understood all the themes and ideas of this game ..."]</review>

    <summary>Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles. Inspired by cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional cel animation (hand drawn &amp; hand inked!), watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings. Play as Cuphead or Mugman (in single player or co-op) as you traverse strange worlds, acquire new weapons, learn powerful super moves, and discover hidden secrets. Cuphead is all action, all the time.</summary>

      <review>but it still didn't quite enamour me like I'd wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen</review>
      <review>often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information</review>

      <review>'Loved this a lot. I missed the sense of exploration from Dark Souls</review>
      <review>but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it. Other than a basic whole number for your damage and health</review>
      <review>there\'s no worrying about RPG values here. It\'s a true action game taking place within the open-world Metroid-ish Souls structure</review>
      <review>backed up with\n \n some\n \n items and buffs and junk if you decide to use them. But the lack of gear is probably the best thing about this - no armour sets</review>
      <review>no elemental stats</review>
      <review>no sword that deals +5 damage but -2 stamina. Funnily enough</review>

      <review>which I greatly prefer. No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I don\'t like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better</review>
      <review>because then it\'s this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled</review>
      <review>or I said "screw it"</review>
      <review>summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly</review>
      <review>once you get that perfect parry timing down</review>
      <review>sometimes victory comes so fast that it\n \n almost\n \n feels unsatisfying. Happened to me with the final boss</review>
      <review>funnily enough.'</review>
      <review>'It only took me three playthroughs but I finally like this game! Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout</review>
      <review>though</review>
      <review>which isn\'t new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a "correct" way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble</review>
      <review>but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you that\'s bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing that\'s bad and sucks</review>
      <review>and that\'s bad and sucks.'</review>
      <review>"Toujours en balance avec Bloodborne et Dark Souls pour le titre de meilleur jeu de chez FromSoftware. Une caméra un peu capricieuse par moments mais sinon c'est intestable."</review>

    <summary>Final Fantasy VII is the seventh main installment in the Final Fantasy series, and was the first title to feature three-dimensional graphics, pre-rendered backgrounds and numerous full motion videos. The gameplay is a departure from previous entries in the series in many ways. Though it retains the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system, FFVII features three party members rather than four. The Materia system allows the player to customize each party member's abilities to their liking, and the Limit system grants them unique combat skills. Though minigames had been a recurring feature, FFVII introduces numerous new ones, many of them playable in the theme park Gold Saucer varying from racing with Chocobos to snowboarding.</summary>

    <summary>Resident Evil 2 is a remake of 1998's Resident Evil 2. The game was not developed with the intent of improving the original, but rather a reimagining of the original story with redesigned maps, characters and story elements.

      <review>["I remember not thinking too much about the original RE2. Don't get me wrong</review>
      <review>it's a great game</review>
      <review>but with REmake</review>
      <review>RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch</review>
      <review>but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever</review>
      <review>with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this</review>
      <review>being incredibly realistic yet stylized</review>
      <review>even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasn't worth it because the story barely changed</review>
      <review>but that's completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories</review>
      <review>but they also have different accessible rooms</review>
      <review>gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one</review>
      <review>and although that's also the case here</review>
      <review>both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way. This is easily my favorite RE game (at least until 4 Remake comes out) and one of my top 5 games of all time</review>
      <review>so you better believe that I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone."</review>
      <review>'My entry point of the series (don’t ask) this remake of my first entry of the series and causing it to grow my love for the series in general this game is really really good and I had a fun time overall when playing this game and since I’m rating this out of pure nostalgia of Raccoon City and overall experience I think this game really deserves 5 stars but when playing this game I got really bad luck with its rng of Mr X and some Lickers since they actually keep killing me and at one point made a somewhat of a stun lock move so I have to take out half a star but it’s still worth playing since it is a very beautiful upgrade to the game I played as a kid and it’s as good as I remember'</review>

    <summary>The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game set five years after the events of The Last of Us. The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. He can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The game intermittently switches control between Ellie and Abby, and also briefly Joel in the opening sequence. The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat.</summary>

      <review>não compre esperando um jogo com história complexa e tocante</review>
      <review>é uma história bobinha só para não deixar os personagem estarem ali só por estar.\n \n A melhor parte do jogo é definitivamente a gameplay e o level desing</review>
      <review>esses dois fatores combinam tão bem juntos que depois de se acostumar ao jogo</review>
      <review>mesmo sendo a primeira vez na fase tu já vê um possível atalho ou ate mesmo um segredo.\n \n Acho esse jogo muito pouco reconhecido</review>
      <review>tanto que eu só fui descobrir que ele lançou 4 meses depois do seu lançamento.'</review>
      <review>'A high-speed mix of a puzzle platformer and FPS</review>
      <review>\n \n Neon White\n \n is a stylish speedrunner\'s dream. You play as the eponymous "Neon White" as you fight demons to improve your credit score enough to not be vaporized by the forces of Heaven for another year</review>
      <review>in a vague\n \n The World Ends With You\n \n type competition. To assist in your demon hunting</review>
      <review>there are a number of different weapon cards that provide some ammunition</review>
      <review>or a secondary movement ability. While defeating all the demons in a level is the stated goal</review>
      <review>in reality the game is about navigating yourself between platforms</review>
      <review>using the ability of the cards to assist you. The environments are great looking</review>
      <review>and the soundtrack is incredible. The game has an arcade/Dreamcast gameplay loop</review>
      <review>where it\'s incredibly addicting to play level after level</review>
      <review>memorizing the way forward to get the best times. If this game was just a level select screen</review>
      <review>I think it might be my favorite game of the year thus far</review>
      <review>but sadly this game has one major flaw</review>
      <review>and that is the plot. It\'s an incredibly stereotypical anime amnesia plot full of boring psychopathic enemies</review>
      <review>cringy sexual innuendos</review>
      <review>and awful voice acting. Yes</review>
      <review>I know the guy who played Spike is in it</review>
      <review>but this is not his best performance. I ended up muting the voice audio</review>
      <review>and that helped quite a bit</review>
      <review>but the plot still has nothing to offer. If you skip all the cutscenes though</review>
      <review>I think this game is definitely a must play.'</review>
      <review>'This gets 4 stars because of the great artstyle</review>
      <review>S tier Machine Girl music</review>
      <review>interesting gameplay gimmics</review>

      <review>NEON WHITE!\n \n A gameplay é absurdamente prazerosa</review>
      <review>misturando tiroteios freneticos com um sistema parkour.\n \n Em relação a Visual Novel e a historia</review>

    <summary>Resident Evil 4 is the sixth installment of the Resident Evil series praised as a revolution from the core games. It was the first title to implement a third-person view rather than the original fixed camera angles its predecessors had. Its mechanics have been completely revamped to incorporate fast-paced gunplay, quick controls and shoot-outs involving massive crowds of enemies in more open areas. The brand-new AI system and open environments allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. Resident Evil 4 had one of the most tormented developments in any game, four proposed versions of the game were discarded by the developers before the finished product was released.</summary>

      <review>ele não é só mais um jogo qualquer da franquia</review>
      <review>é a nova direção da série</review>

      <review>mas será que Sonic Frontiers é um bom jogo mesmo com algumas polêmicas ? A resposta é sim</review>
      <review>ele é um ótimo jogo !'</review>
      <review>'Better than Forces and Lost World but that’s not saying much. Overworld was cool to explore but it was trying too hard to be Breath of the Wild. Combat was literally just mashing Y which wasn’t fun. The platforming stages remove the camera control which just makes you fly off the side if you don’t know what’s coming up. At least it looked pretty aside from the generic looking enemies.'</review>
      <review>"Maybe I'll try again in the future</review>
      <review>but this isn't doing it for me. It was alright at first</review>
      <review>but soon outstayed it's welcome."</review>
      <review>'Excited for the sequel assuming they don’t completely change the formula again because this is a really solid foundation that feels fresh if a little bare bones at times. Super fun to run around and the music is really nice. Glad to have a story where the characters take the events seriously without joking every 5 seconds. The story itself is ok</review>
      <review>but the final act is clearly unfinished and rushed has probably one of the worst final bosses in the whole series which really undermines the ending a bit. Excited for the content updates (SEGA needs to give these devs the time and resources to release a game in a fully finished state).'</review>

    <reviews>
      <review>['PEAK. A near flawless game for me and really encapsulates what I love about the medium. Exceptional effort and turned out just as well as I’d hoped. I’ve beaten it 5 times now (granted new game plus with all your upgrades and knowing where to go makes it much easier). I did find it to be very difficult at points and it can be somewhat easy to get lost. Also a vital system for progression can be too cryptic</review>
      <review>but rewarding once you crack it. That’s about my only gripes. Must play game. Gorgeous artstyle</review>
      <review>no handholdy nonsense</review>
      <review>fun gameplay</review>
      <review>top tier OST</review>
      <review>great story</review>
      <review>and an overall perfect action-adventure game. It’s littered with secrets as well so your exploration is rewarded (pay attention to the manual!). Andrew Shouldice goated fr 5/5 ⭑'</review>
      <review>"Tunic is a wonderful 2D Zelda-like that feels like a love letter to the genre. Between an extremely charming aesthetic</review>
      <review>fun and interesting items</review>
      <review>and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery</review>
      <review>it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre. The inclusions of things like a made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were a kid trying to play a game like Link's Awakening. Discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player. I feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game</review>
      <review>so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing. Level design is top notch in this game and I love all the secrets and hidden paths they provide using the game's isometric view. I think the weakest parts of this game compared to its contemporaries is the mood of the game."</review>
      <review>'Tunic es un buen juego que no he podido disfrutar al máximo. Aunque la jugabilidad es buena y está bastante pulida</review>
      <review>la historia</review>
      <review>o lo que yo he entendido</review>
      <review>me ha gustado mucho y la BSO cumple bastante</review>
      <review>la mecánica de que todo gire en torno al manual y el no poder entender la gran mayoría de la información que tienes o encuentras me ha fastidiado mucho la experiencia. Dicho esto</review>
      <review>no es juego que yo recomendaría'</review>
      <review>'Like 5 minutes after finding the rey key I found the map to that dungeon and honestly I find that pretty funny'</review>

      <review>eu nunca vi nenhum jogo apresentar suas mecânicas dessa forma</review>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the fifth main installment of The Legend of Zelda series and the first to be released for the Nintendo 64. It was one of the most highly anticipated games of its age, and is listed among the greatest video games ever created by numerous websites and magazines. The gameplay of Ocarina of Time was revolutionary for its time, it has arguably made more of an impact on later games in the series than any of its predecessors even though they had the same cores of exploration, dungeons, puzzles and item usage. Among the gameplay mechanics, one of the most noteworthy is the time-traveling system. The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well and each of them has certain unique abilities. Ocarina of Time also introduces the use of music to solve puzzles: as new songs are learned, they can be used to solve puzzles, gain access to new areas and warp to different locations. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games but they are not too complex.</summary>

The player is urged to turn everything into a weapon: biologically modifying their own body with Plasmids, hacking devices and systems, upgrading their weapons, crafting new ammo variants, and experimenting with different battle techniques are all possible. The game is described by the developers as a spiritual successor to their previous PC title System Shock 2. BioShock received high praise in critical reviews for its atmospheric audio and visual quality, absorbing and original plot and its unique gaming experience.</summary>

    <summary>Metal Gear Solid is a stealth game created by Hideo Kojima which follows the MSX2 video games Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. Despite a transition to 3D, Metal Gear Solid's gameplay remains similar to his predecessors. The game utilizes a traditional top-down view and the player must navigate the protagonist Solid Snake through the game's areas without being detected. Detection will set off an alarm which draws armed enemies to his location. Conversations with Snake's allies and cutscenes are used extensively to advance the plot and gain more insight into it. Metal Gear Solid is regarded as one of the greatest and most important video games of all time, and helped popularize the stealth genre and in-engine cinematic cutscenes.</summary>

    <summary>BioShock Infinite is the third game in the BioShock series. It is not a direct sequel/prequel to any of the previous BioShock games but takes place in an entirely different setting, although it shares similar features, gameplay and concepts with the previous games. BioShock Infinite features a range of environments that force the player to adapt, with different weapons and strategies for each situation. Interior spaces feature close combat with enemies, but unlike previous games set in Rapture, the setting of Infinite contains open spaces with emphasis on sniping and ranged combat against as many as fifteen enemies at once.</summary>

      <review>['The combat feels empty. The bows feel like they have very little weight to them and the character movement feels extremely unnatural. i really want to like this game but it hasnt given me a reason to continue playing. Also some of the worst writing and generic side quests ive seen in an open world game.'</review>

      <review>"(Played before 2023)\n \n Big fan of this game. It is a really unique idea of robotic dinosaurs combined with a lush</review>
      <review>vibrant post-apocalyptic world. The soundtrack is really good and I enjoyed the characters quite a bit</review>
      <review>even if they could feel quite dimensional. You don't really get that many RPG elements so you can't really focus or build on specific aspects</review>
      <review>but it reminds me of a more streamlined monster hunter when combating robots using only slings and arrows. I think the game definitely was missing a lot of aspects that are commonplace in the genre</review>
      <review>but this was their first open-world game. There were frustrating moments</review>
      <review>and a lot of the times enemies move too quickly even during slow-mo to let you take advantage of shooting weak points</review>
      <review>and I think the melee combat is pretty terrible. A light and a heavy sweep</review>
      <review>that is pretty much it. The platforming is really good but also got annoying to traverse sometimes</review>
      <review>epseically with how many mountain areas there are. I'd recommend it though</review>
      <review>for a first attempt they did a great job."</review>

    <summary>Left 4 Dead 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter video game, the sequel to Valve Corporation's Left 4 Dead. The Game builds upon cooperatively focused gameplay and Valve's proprietary Source engine, the same game engine used in the original Left 4 Dead. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, Left 4 Dead 2 focuses on four new Survivors, fighting against hordes of the Infected, who develop severe psychosis and exhibit zombie-like tendencies. The Survivors must fight their way through five campaigns, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of escape at each campaign's finale.</summary>

    <summary>Enter the Splatlands, a sun-scorched desert inhabited by battle-hardened Inklings and Octolings. Splatsville, the city of chaos, is the adrenaline-fueled heart of this dusty wasteland. Even in this desolate environment, Turf War reigns supreme and battles rage in new stages located in the surrounding wilds. Dynamic new moves help these fighters dodge attacks and cover more ground, along with a new bow-shaped weapon to sling ink.</summary>

      <review>["after being skeptical for a year after it was announced because of the game taking place in a rough post-apocalypse desert (a trope I love splatoon 2 for avoiding despite it's post-apocalypse setting)</review>
      <review>I eventually came around as the release date came closer and more promising things were revealed. this turned out pretty good. more splatoon with more stuff</review>
      <review>but unfortunately doesn’t reach any of 2's heights except for some of the new gameplay tweaks. playing w/ friends is better than ever</review>

Aided with your trusty katana, the time manipulation drug Chronos and the rest of your assassin's arsenal, fight your way through a fractured city, and take back what's rightfully yours.</summary>

      <review>["It's fairly good. Combat is crunchy if not perfectly controllable</review>
      <review>plot's interesting even if the dialogue can get a bit too dense sometimes</review>
      <review>music is good even if it's hard to appreciate in context. It's just a bit short; the ending is a bit abrupt although not entirely unsatisfying and the game doesn't get enough time to really flesh out the mechanics</review>
      <review>so getting the rest out of your purchase is left to the speedrun mode</review>
      <review>which suffers from some of the less pleasant bits (club stealth section straight from hell). It's not bad enough to leave you wanting</review>
      <review>though. I'm not big on the slow motion mechanic either; the slow mo is too extreme to be fun to use in combat and the systems are usually more fun to engage with in real time."</review>

      <review>haven't laughed at a game this much in a long time. I think the pacing is a bit odd but I guess with a game that can be beaten in &lt;10 hours it needs to ramp up pretty immediately.

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a top-down action game with puzzle-solving elements similar to the original The Legend of Zelda. After the side-scrolling and RPG-like gameplay of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, the game is a return to the top-down view and gameplay style of the first installment. It introduces major new items to the series such as the Master Sword and the concept of two different worlds, which was revisited to some extent in Ocarina of Time with two distinct time periods rather than dark and light worlds.</summary>

      <review>'Objectively speaking maybe the best 2D Zelda ever made.\n \n Personally speaking</review>
      <review>beating it in a week after spending six months on the original Legend of Zelda game was a massive disappointment. I hate that they decided to indicate where dungeons were on the map.'</review>

    <summary>Silent Hill is the first installment in the Silent Hill series of psychological survival horror video games. Unlike earlier survival horror games that focused on protagonists with combat training, the main character Harry Mason is an average man. The gameplay consists of combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The controller vibration is used to indicate Harry's heartbeat and will vibrate on low health. The player must regularly enter an inventory screen to check Harry's health, use items, and equip different weapons.</summary>

This edition introduces super attacks referred to as final smashes: activated by destroying smash balls, these feature powerful and often unstoppable attacks, regularly introducing a major transformation of the character. This edition also introduces a brand new adventure mode in The Subspace Emissary which is a side-scrolling adventure in the style of a platformer. It retains all basic mechanics of the Super Smash Bros. series, such as a damage meter, stocks, and Smash-style attacks.</summary>

      <review>["This game is excellent. I suck at it</review>
      <review>but it's so much fun. Assassin's Creed wishes it could do this."</review>
      <review>'Dishonored\n \n is one of the few games I\'ve ever played where a direct recommendation of "play this with a controller/keyboard and mouse" cannot be made. Generally speaking</review>
      <review>I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth</review>
      <review>like racing games</review>
      <review>is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard</review>
      <review>all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good</review>
      <review>you\'re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion</review>
      <review>it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night. If that\'s how you choose to play\n \n Dishonored\n \n</review>
      <review>I recommend it. Leaning and inventory management can feel a little less natural than they would on a keyboard</review>
      <review>but they\'re functional and aren\'t as distracting as they could potentially be. In the words of Godd Howard himself</review>
      <review>"it just works."'</review>
      <review>'They tried so hard... and got so far. But in the end</review>
      <review>it falls short in a lot of ways.'</review>

      <review>I really enjoyed this game.'</review>

    <summary>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is the prequel to the entire Metal Gear series. Most of the series' defining gameplay elements have been carried over and as before, Snake must use stealth and wits rather than brute force to infiltrate enemy zones and eliminate his major adversaries. Unlike the previous games, this installment takes place in a large outdoor jungle. Snake is able to use camouflage, climb trees, hide in tall grass or wear clothes that make him less noticeable.</summary>

    <summary>Kingdom Hearts is an action role-playing game developed and published by Squaresoft for the PlayStation 2. It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square. Kingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position. The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.</summary>

    <summary>In the future, humans have left Earth and settled throughout the galaxy. On Mars, the Union Aerospace Corporation has established a radioactive waste facility and allowed the military to conduct teleportation experiments on the nearby moons of Deimos and Phobos. Hours ago, the base on Mars began receiving incoherent distress messages from Phobos, while Deimos has disappeared completely. With all attempts to establish contact failing, you and your team have been dispatched to investigate. Upon arrival, you secure the perimeter as the rest of your team enters the facility. As you stand guard, your radio crackles with the sound of gunfire, cracking bones and blood-curdling screams and eventually falls silent. Alone, with no way off the planet or means to defend yourself other than your trusty pistol, there’s only one way out - into the complex of death and the horrors that await you within. If you plan to get out of here alive you must fend off the hordes of demonic imps, haunting spectres and your undead, former comrades waiting to tear you limb from limb. So, grab the nearest shotgun and blast your way out of this fragging madness!</summary>

What other stories will you uncover on the horizon...?</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["A really solid anthology of mini gold era Square RPGs lost to time</review>
      <review>now easily accessible via this HD2D remake. Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Square's Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesn't play by the book."</review>
      <review>'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways</review>
      <review>and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways</review>
      <review>so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game</review>
      <review>but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game</review>
      <review>but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho</review>
      <review>I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me</review>
      <review>each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively</review>
      <review>and while it’s far from a difficult game</review>
      <review>each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake</review>
      <review>it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others</review>
      <review>I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters</review>
      <review>I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.'</review>
      <review>"Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that I'd honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at. The battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people (it was a bit of a blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all."</review>
      <review>"Honestly</review>
      <review>there just wasn't enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters don't encourage exploration</review>
      <review>the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved</review>
      <review>and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to</review>
      <review>and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPG's</review>
      <review>even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring</review>
      <review>the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming</review>
      <review>I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome."</review>
      <review>"The best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game."</review>
      <review>'Rough around the edges in the gameplay department</review>
      <review>but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.']</review>

    <summary>Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D, side-scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop-the-loops. The levels contain hazards in the form of robots ("badniks" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground. Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection. The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress. At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues). When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a "Secret Zone" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a "goal block" (which ends the level).</summary>

      <review>["I really enjoyed this one. The story is super interesting</review>
      <review>most characters are multi-layered and more complex than they initially seem</review>
      <review>and how this game handles skills and thoughts is genius. As most reviews for this game have said</review>
      <review>it's really great that failing a skill check does not necessarily mean you're now going through a worse version of the game (in some cases it's even a more fun route). The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media. I personally found myself more engrossed by the game's study of the main character</review>
      <review>who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character</review>
      <review>but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\n \n On that note</review>
      <review>the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane</review>
      <review>and they really don't feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character. Once again</review>
      <review>this contributes heavily into making the player fit into the role-playing aspect of this game more</review>
      <review>as their choices contribute to the type of cop they want to be."</review>

    <summary>Mario Kart Wii is a multiplayer-oriented racing game for the Wii, and the sixth main installment in the Mario Kart series. Mario Kart Wii retains the traditional item-based weaponry familiar with the franchise, where players can select a Mario franchise driver and themed vehicles. As with most racing games, the overarching goal is to place first among other competitors, through the usage of such items and taking the fastest routes to secure the leads. Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities. A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers. Game modes are also present such as the traditional Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial modes.</summary>

Players will spend most of their time playing as Jill Valentine, although on some occasions they will assume the role of Carlos Oliveira, giving him more screen time as a deuteragonist.</summary>

    <summary>On the planet Dahna, reverence has always been given to Rena--the planet in the sky--as a land of the righteous and divine. Stories handed down for generations became truth and masked reality for the people of Dahna. For 300 years, Rena has ruled over Dahna, pillaging the planet of its resources and stripping people of their dignity and freedom. Our tale begins with two people, born on different worlds, each looking to change their fate and create a new future. Featuring a diverse cast of characters, intuitive and rewarding combat system, and a captivating story set in a lush world worth fighting for, Tales of Arise delivers a first-class JRPG experience.</summary>

      <review>["As a long-time Tales fan</review>
      <review>I had high hopes for this game. And I must say that while there are good highs to the experience (such as the combat)</review>
      <review>there are also awful lows (the 3rd act of the game). The result is a slightly above-average game. If you're here for the combat</review>
      <review>you'll have a fantastic time. Even though it can get repetitive at times</review>
      <review>it's flashy</review>
      <review>fluid</review>
      <review>and the best the series has ever been. This is only made better by the fantastic soundtrack. I honestly did not mind listening to the same battle tracks for the duration of my almost 60-hour journey. It's that good."</review>
      <review>"I want to start this by saying that i really</review>
      <review>\n \n desperately\n \n wanted to like this game. Genuinely. I was so excited to start it as I'm quite a fan of the series."</review>
      <review>'the ending wasðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®'</review>
      <review>"I thought this was pretty good for the most part. The last quarter was a little too frustrating though. I was way underleveled even after completing pretty much all side quests. I bumped it down to easy mode for a bit just to gain some mindless levels. It didn't feel good and I don't remember this being an issue in previous Tales games. It didn't seem to have enough content to provide a smooth leveling experience. Eventually I did beat the final boss and could shelve it but it wasn't the huge satisfying moment I was hoping for.\n \n This was far from my favorite in the series but not terrible so give it a shot if it sounds like your thing but prepare to fiddle with the difficulty near the end."</review>
      <review>"Summary: Great gameplay</review>
      <review>god awful story. It's a nice enough game to play despite how dull the story and characters are up until it faceplants during the final act.\n \n Beating things up is fun enough to where I think most people forgave the flaws (as a cursory look at the reviews here seems to show)</review>
      <review>but I just can't overlook all the issues it has."</review>
      <review>'gameplay is some of the best Tales has seen so far</review>
      <review>however the story and characters turned me off more so than other Tales games. Made it right to the\n \n SPOILERS\n \n false ending</review>
      <review>lost interest after.']</review>

The sequel retains many elements from its predecessor, such as the adventure being in outer space, the element of gravity, and recurring objects such as Launch Stars and Sling Stars. Returning items include the Bee Mushroom and the Fire Flower. However, the game introduces new elements as well, such as the utilization of Yoshi, new power-ups like the Cloud Flower, and the use of a guide within the game for beginner players.</summary>

    <summary>Donkey Kong Country is a side scrolling platformer by British developers Rare in 1994. It featured revolutionary pre-rendered 3D graphics that give the game a very unique look compared to most other games on consoles at the time. The two playable characters featured in the game are the titular character, Donkey Kong and his nephew, Diddy Kong. Together the two swing, climb, jump, swim, cartwheel, ride animals, and blast out of barrels on their way to recover their stolen bannanas from the evil King K. Rool and his Kremling army. The adventure takes you through a variety of different environments and levels that continually change up gameplay. Donkey Kong Country also provides plenty of opportunities for exploration with almost every level having a multitude of collectible, shortcuts, and hidden bonus areas.</summary>

    <summary>What Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of short stories about a cursed family in Washington State. Each story offers a chance to experience the life of a different family member with stories ranging from the early 1900s to the present day. The gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the family members themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death. It's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us. You'll follow Edith Finch as she explores the history of her family and tries to figure out why she's the last Finch left alive.</summary>

      <review>e acho difícil que enquanto jogo de pirata ele irá ser superado tão cedo. Felizmente todo o potencial desperdiçado do assassin's creed III é aproveitado aqui. As caçadas são recompensadoras</review>
      <review>assim como toda a exploração. Certo</review>
      <review>talvez explorar um local para pegar baús que rendem pouco dinheiro não seja lá muito recompensador</review>
      <review>mas ainda é divertido explorar esse mapa gigante</review>
      <review>principalmente porque a escalada é muito valorizada e a quantidade de coletáveis é satisfatória</review>
      <review>não exagerada e não pequena demais. As batalhas navais são fantásticas</review>

      <review>pois você precisa melhorae seu navio</review>
      <review>e isso dá uma sensação de recompensa nos combates navais. Explorar áreas submersas</review>
      <review>uma das minhas partes preferidas</review>
      <review>te dá plantas para melhorar o navio</review>
      <review>o que une a divertida exploração subaquática com um sistema bem equilibrado de recompensa.\n \n Sinceramente</review>
      <review>a história não é tão complexa ou elaborada</review>
      <review>mas e carismática o bastante para ser muito imersiva. O final chega a ser emocionante</review>
      <review>na dosagem certa para dar um sentimento de que tudo que jogamos teve propósito no fim.\n \n Todas as atividades secundárias são elogiáveis</review>
      <review>desde saquear um armazém até pegar coletáveis como as canções. Os objetivos secundários são bem balanceados</review>
      <review>não atrapalha sua jogatina como nos anteriores e é mais um extra para desafiad ou orientar o jogador.\n \n Um dos meus jogos preferidos da vida</review>
      <review>sem dúvidas</review>
      <review>e um dos que mais joguei e ainda assim me faltam palavras para expressar o quanto acho ele divertido. Foi o primeiro da saga em que não só desejei sinceramente fazer 100% de sincronização como também o único que me diverti tentando</review>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is the last Zelda game for GameCube, it was highly anticipated by many members of the gaming community and was regarded as finally fulfilling the dreams of those who wanted a much more realistic and mature game than the ones before. The art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of The Wind Waker. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. New to this game is the ability for Link to transform into a Wolf when entering the Twilight. As a wolf, Link can use his senses to solve puzzles and get past obstacles, he can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees. Twilight Princess has received universal acclaim from reviewers and journalists, who cited it as the greatest Zelda game of all time.</summary>

      <review>play for 5 hours</review>
      <review>and then fight 3 more at the tail end)</review>
      <review>and some weapons feel underutilized (I barely touched the super variants until the Metroid Prime fight) but it's a blast and really retains the feel of a 2D Metroid game at its core</review>
      <review>with platforming as a main focus."</review>
      <review>"Neat game. Controls were a bit interesting to get used to</review>
      <review>but the game is built around them so there wasn't really much of a problem. I do wish the FOV was a bit bigger and you could see where you are landing when you have to do platforming</review>
      <review>though. This game does a good job in putting the metroid formula in 3D</review>
      <review>but because it is now in 3D</review>
      <review>theres a lot more nooks and crannies that things are hidden in</review>
      <review>so you have to definitely have your eyes more peeled than the 2D metroids. The map system is also more difficult to understand than the 2D metroids. I didn't even really have a problem with the mandatory mcguffin hunt at the end or the constant backtracking</review>
      <review>since those are kind of staples of the Metroid series and serve to give you more opportunities to find secrets by constantly returning to places you have been before. Putting a fast travel option would completely defeat the purpose imo. At the end of the day</review>
      <review>this game didn't blow me away like it did for so many other people</review>
      <review>but I can still see a decent game when I play one</review>
      <review>and this is definitely that."</review>
      <review>"honestly i don't think there's anything out there as magical as this"</review>
      <review>"I wasn't satisfied with my previous review on this</review>

    <summary>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is the final canonical Metal Gear game to feature Solid Snake as the main character. The gameplay of the previous games have been kept along with some new features, such as the ability to roll on your back and also to hide in bins scattered around the environment. Most of the story and the relationship between the characters are explained through cut-scenes with a considerable length, so knowledge of the prior games is recommended to fully understand the story. The game also features a complex multiplayer mode entitled Metal Gear Online with some original missions based on the stealth aspects of the single-player games.</summary>

      <review>"yeah its just fanservice but i eat that shit up b. expect movie-length cutscenes constantly and a really dumb plot that tries to connect to everything and ends up feeling like its connecting to nothing. Gameplay is also p cool too with the octocamo feature pretty much getting rid of the annoying menu nonsense of game 3. A lot of people don't like this game that much due to how much it jumps the shark</review>
      <review>but as a resident shark-jumping enthusiast I had a blast with this game. Too bad it requires a got damn playstation 3 to be played even to this day."]</review>

In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.</summary>

    <summary>Scorn is an atmospheric first person horror adventure game set in a nightmarish universe of odd forms and somber tapestry. It is designed around an idea of "being thrown into the world". Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself. Every location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive lived in world. Throughout the game you will open up new areas, acquire different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to comprehend the sights presented to you.</summary>

      <review>even compared to some of the weaker fire emblem titles. it\'s a shame that the series went the direction it did since awakening as a launching point had a lot of good ideas and potential but i guess we had to run with mostly the bad ones for fates and just throw shit at the wall until it sticks after']</review>

Your decisions will control the outcome of each mission, your relationships with your crew and ultimately the entire war. An amazing universe to explore.

    <summary>Kingdom Hearts III is the third main installment in the Kingdom Hearts series developed and published by Square Enix. It was initially released January 2019 for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. An expansion, Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind was released in January 2020. The story takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. It features an older Sora as the main protagonist, who sets forth on a new adventure to search for seven guardians of light in an attempt to stop Xehanort from bringing about a second Keyblade War. Sora is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Riku, Kairi, and others. Along the way, Sora travels to many worlds from Disney and Pixar intellectual properties, and cross paths with the real Organization XIII. Kingdom Hearts III features hack and slash combat reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts II, with elements from later handheld entries, allowing the player to control Sora in a party with Donald, Goofy, and up to two other Disney characters from the various worlds he visits. A major addition compared is the Formchange mechanic, which allows his currently equipped Keyblade to grant him special abilities and change shape. Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time, and cycle between them to use his abilities. Another addition is the Attractions mechanic, which occasionally allows Sora to summon and pilot a vehicle inspired by Disney theme park attractions. At certain points throughout the game, the player will be able to control other characters.</summary>

      <review>and I don't like how they're focusing on disney so much. Give me 2B in kh4 or something. The story is as confusing as it gets</review>
      <review>but it's such a climatic story that feels like you didn't waste 100 hours playing the other ones. The gameplay is a bit repetitive and I don't care much for the disney ride stuff</review>

    <summary>Fallout 3 from the creators of the award-winning Oblivion, featuring one of the most realized game worlds ever created. Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future. The third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.</summary>

    <summary>The first game in the Zero Escape series, originally made as a standalone title "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors". The Zero Escape rebranding and alternative cover of the game were released around the time of the Sequel "Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward". The game is a murder mystery visual novel with a heavy story focus that requires multiple playthroughs to figure out and involves puzzle rooms used to progress through the story with dialogue choices to be made inbetween them. The iOS version of the game removed the puzzle rooms to focus more on the visual novel aspects of the game. The puzzle rooms are replaced with narration of the events that take place instead. The iOS version of the game also has an exclusive ending.</summary>

Joined by his partner, ex-yakuza Masaharu Kaito, the crime-fighting duo is called on to investigate a seemingly perfect crime whose lead suspect has an airtight alibi. What starts out as a tale of revenge reveals a tangled web of conspiracy involving several unlikely factions taking advantage of a broken law system. But as victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, he must choose between defending the law or exacting justice.</summary>

    <summary>Silent Hill 3 is the third installment in the Silent Hill survival horror series and a direct sequel to the first game, although this is kept secret from the player for plot twist purposes. Like the previous entries, Silent Hill 3 is a survival horror combining action-based combat and puzzle-solving, but is somewhat more combat-oriented than the preceding installments. The main character is able to side-step and block some attacks, but in general shares with the other protagonists of the series their relative ineptitude in combat.</summary>

      <review>['persona 3 taught me how to love rpg’s and despite its flaws and Portable’s emphasis on the visual novel aspects</review>
      <review>this is still one of the greatest games i’ve ever played. femc for life'</review>
      <review>'I mean for every two steps it takes in the right direction one is taken back. Just remake it the story and characters are phenomenal but the gameplay is rough man'</review>
      <review>"Probably the biggest surprise this year for me. I didn't expect to enjoy this game as much as I did having never played a Persona game and not typically being a fan of turn based JRPGs that aren't Pokemon.\n \n There are a few things that hold it back from being amazing. Tartarus can be very repetitive as a dungeon that you're constantly forced to crawl through</review>
      <review>and there is some pacing issues when it comes to the leveling system where it took me forever to grind</review>
      <review>but then you hit a wall and once you do leveling and your characters well-being becoming non-issues.\n \n But nonetheless</review>
      <review>still an amazing game. It would definitely be higher for me but I can't with good conscience give it a higher rating because this remastered version of P3 is definitely a drop in quality in a lot of aspects from what I've seen</review>
      <review>and from what I've seen and heard</review>
      <review>the next two games are on another levels above this one</review>
      <review>which I'm very excited to play for myself."</review>
      <review>"Played through on the FeMC route. Good game</review>
      <review>with some great social links and killer music. It pales in comparison to both versions of Persona 2</review>
      <review>but Persona 3 is where the visual novel and skill/social aspect first came into play for the series. Tartarus (the game's main dungeon) can become wildly repetitive</review>
      <review>and the story and early social links were lackluster. The combat and fusion systems were good</review>
      <review>and the music was of course phenomenal. There were a few pieces keeping this from being an excellent game</review>
      <review>but overall had a blast with this one!"</review>
      <review>'GOAT'</review>
      <review>"I started my Persona journey with Persona 5 and then worked my way backward through Persona 4 and now Persona 3. If I had played this one first I think I may have liked it better</review>
      <review>but it doesn't even come close to 4 and 5 for me. It plays much more like a visual novel and the story and social links are pure ass for many</review>
      <review>many hours. Things improve as you go on but I just wanted it to be over."]</review>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is the first Zelda game made exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS. It is an indirect sequel to A Link to the Past with the same version of Hyrule but with new characters and gameplay elements. Unlike the series' tradition, many areas of the world are accessible from the beginning of the game and the dungeons can be visited in any order. Puzzles are encountered not only in dungeons but also in the open world, a part of them revolves around the game's 3D visual effect. The 3DS touch-screen display shows the world, dungeon or map depending on where you are.</summary>

    <summary>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is a top-down action adventure game that tells the origins of the evil Vaati from Four Swords. Like most other titles in the series, The Minish Cap features the fully explorable land of Hyrule, although it can be viewed from the eyes of a human or the eyes of a Minish, a race of tiny people and an alternate form that Link can transform into. Unlike the multiplayer focus of the other games in the series, The Minish Cap retains the original form of exploration and dungeons as seen in A Link to the Past, Oracle of Seasons, and Oracle of Ages, as well as returning characters and game mechanics such as Malon and the Spin Attack. New features include fusing Kinstones and shrinking to the size of a Minish.</summary>

As Soma, you must navigate the castle's labyrinths while confronting perilous monsters at every turn. But beware, you must escape before the evil consumes you!</summary>

      <review>['An immensely satisfying game with a rich</review>
      <review>dark atmosphere. The sprites are all phenomenal</review>
      <review>especially for the bosses</review>
      <review>which are some of the coolest I\'ve ever seen- the buildups to Legion and Balore are fucking incredible. The Souls system is really fun and makes enemy encounters so much more exciting- it reminded me a lot of collecting espers in Final Fantasy VI</review>
      <review>which shares a similar aesthetic design. There are so many different abilities which almost all have the amazing animations (some extraordinarily goofy</review>
      <review>like Cagnazzo and Creaking Skull) Collecting all the enemy souls makes backtracking and late game wandering a lot more fun</review>
      <review>even if it does get pretty grindy. I really really loved this</review>
      <review>but to be fair i do have to point out that the dialogue is very silly and the "plot" suffers for it.'</review>

      <review>"Favorite Castlevania thus far. Absolutely addicting the whole way through and never stops being fun. Ain't perfect but I greatly enjoyed my time."</review>
      <review>'super solid but i feel like the true final boss prerequisites were a little silly in this game'</review>
      <review>'Castlevania Aria of Sorrow is "cool". It is cool in how the spritework gives you a set of stylish animations and enemies to overcome. It is cool in the music having a trend of being upbeat yet spooky to make one feel heroic. It is cool in despite having minimal story the characters are all bad"sses in their own right with their own motivations for traversing such a dangerous place. The only downsides to the game is that the progression feels rather tame in such a sprawling labrynthian castle. New paths rarely feel like it is because you got some unique movement option like Ori or Metroid</review>
      <review>but instead because you decided to travel one of the many routes that branched off of the one you chose earlier.']</review>

Besides the complete graphical and sound overhaul, its gameplay controls have been changed to incorporate the additional buttons the Switch holds as opposed to the 2-button choice of the Game Boy. The overworld map is far more detailed and specific locations can now be marked to be returned to on a later occasion. Additional heart-pieces can also be won, extending the heart meter to a total of 20 instead of the 14 hearts of the original.</summary>

      <review>['O Altair parece um mitra do Cerco</review>

      <review>'In this first game</review>
      <review>the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever</review>
      <review>but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that</review>
      <review>while not lacking in variety</review>
      <review>are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series)</review>
      <review>but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.'</review>
      <review>'Sinceramente</review>
      <review>eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho</review>
      <review>mas</review>
      <review>caramba</review>

      <review>apesar de interessante</review>
      <review>não tem quase nada de carisma</review>
      <review>sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\n \n Para um início</review>
      <review>mesmo levando em conta as limitações</review>
      <review>ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis</review>
      <review>e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas</review>
      <review>mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth</review>
      <review>e isso matou a graça de muitas missões</review>
      <review>pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia</review>
      <review>depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse</review>
      <review>ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta</review>
      <review>dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar</review>
      <review>e as vezes os npcs (os loucos)</review>
      <review>simplesmente me empurravam</review>
      <review>eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão. Eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que não fosse obrigado a fazer para seguir com as principais</review>
      <review>que são todas praticamente iguais e nada recompensadoras.'</review>
      <review>"As someone who played Assassin's Creed back in the day</review>
      <review>I have to say that I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand</review>
      <review>I appreciated the game's unique setting and storyline</review>
      <review>which offered a fresh take on the action-adventure genre. The game's visuals were also impressive for their time</review>

Unfortunately, everybody's home this evening. Bats, ghosts, every kind of creature you can imagine. You'll find 'em all over the place, if they don't find you first. Because you've got to get through six monstrous floors before you even meet up with the Master of the House. Your Magic Whip will help, and you'll probably find a weapons or two along the way.

      <review>as its subtitle suggests</review>
      <review>is one of the more emotionally painful experiences I've had with a game</review>

      <review>but just know that despite how damn funny the humor in this game is</review>
      <review>its revenge narrative and main character are heartwrenching at times. It's difficult to progress in this game at times because of how fucked the next steps that Brad is going to take are. If you're familiar with how dark Mother 3 can get</review>

      <review>but it is an RPGMaker game. I love turn-based combat games</review>
      <review>but LISA doesn't do too much to make its combat exciting. The encounters aren't annoying</review>
      <review>just could've been less repetitive after you figure out what status effects do and how to execute dial combos. Also</review>
      <review>the customization in this game doesn't really do it for me</review>

      <review>great experience that I have to recommend to anyone that enjoys RPGs in the style of the Mother series or Undertale</review>

Its premises chronicle the creation of the titular Crash, a bandicoot who has been uplifted by the mad scientist Doctor Neo Cortex. The goal of Crash Bandicoot is to traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. The game is played from a third-person perspective in which the camera trails behind Crash, though some levels showcase forward-scrolling and side-scrolling perspectives. Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them.</summary>

      <review>I really wanted to like this game a lot. But let's get started with the positives and negatives.\n \n The positive is the atmosphere is great. Really captures that isolation horror that we all love and expected. The shooting and melee combat is meaty and satisfying</review>
      <review>and it still has a lot of the vibes of Dead Space. While not an original story it is still good</review>
      <review>with great performances from the supporting cast. The music is fantastic and atmospheric and really pulls you in</review>
      <review>and the death animations go above and beyond what most games do. Overall these are enough for me to say it is a good game."</review>
      <review>'Me when I love Dead Space'</review>
      <review>"Great game</review>
      <review>love the atmosphere enjoyed the more melee focused combat. Creature design was awesome and wrapped in it was a good story.\n \n I think if this had been released without some of the issues it had it would've done better. Great survival horror game"]</review>

    <summary>The Wolf Among Us is a five episode series from the creators of the 2012 Game of the Year: The Walking Dead. Based on Fables (DC Comics/Vertigo), an award-winning comic book series, it is an often violent, mature and hard-boiled thriller where the characters and creatures of myth, lore and legend are real and exist in our world. As Bigby Wolf - The Big Bad Wolf in human form - you will discover that the brutal, bloody murder of a Fable is just a taste of things to come, in a game series where your every decision can have enormous consequences.</summary>

      <review>['just about the best case scenario for a sequel; maintaining almost everything that made the first one great and building on it in subtle but interesting ways. the core gameplay loop remains fantastic; doesn’t matter how many corridors you trudge through or rooms you clear — every encounter is incredibly tense and exciting. i missed the sort of heavy clunkiness of the original a bit</review>
      <review>but the slightly slicker</review>
      <review>more fluid combat has its merits too and is well motivated character-wise: isaac would be a little more adept at dealing with these things by now. found all the new weapons and mechanics to be mostly fantastic; this time around i favored the seeker rifle</review>
      <review>which in combination with liberal use of stasis absolutely shreds necromorphs. ridiculous name for them btw</review>
      <review>necromorphs lol. the writing in these games is definitely…something. the narrative elements are more foregrounded here which isn’t exactly to its benefit as it’s very silly</review>
      <review>rote stuff when approached on that level. but i did find isaac’s internal meltdown over the course of the game to be visceral (😏) and affecting; the visions of nicole are well realized and implemented. hard for me to buy into this as a story about a man overcoming his grief and guilt tho - partly why i found the final boss encounter (and really the only true boss encounter in the game) to be a little anticlimactic</review>
      <review>especially compared to the last one - and i still think these games would be better with far less narrative context. let it be about a guy walking around fixing machines and fighting alien zombies and that’s it! this marker mythology shit is whatever to me!! but that’s okay. it doesn’t actually impede the experience in any significant way i just don’t think it’s the ideal package for this gameplay. don’t have much if any complaints beyond that; this series remains some of the very best sci-fi/horror action you can find in any medium'</review>
      <review>"Usually regarded as the best title in the trilogy</review>
      <review>and in my opinion for very good reason. Dead Space 2 perfectly balances the horror moments and combat so fluidly that it never seems jarring to be taken from one to the other. Highly</review>
      <review>highly recommend if you're looking to get into some horror game staples."</review>
      <review>'After coming off the back of Dead Space (2023)</review>
      <review>I expected Dead Space 2 to be naturally a little dated since it came out 12 years prior.'</review>
      <review>"The only Dead Space game I've played so far</review>
      <review>and it was pretty awesome. Like a Resident Evil/Doom hybrid</review>
      <review>the atmosphere was dank as fuck</review>
      <review>loved it. I recall picking this up from the bargain bin for like $3! Maybe my best gaming buy ever."</review>
      <review>'Have you ever noticed this trend?'</review>
      <review>'If the first game was good</review>
      <review>the remake of the first was amazing</review>
      <review>then this game is a deceptively disappointing game. Dead Space 2 is the "Aliens" to Dead Space 1\'s "Alien"</review>
      <review>except the effort here to go bigger makes for an overly long narrative that meanders far too much in the second act.']</review>

    <summary>Until Dawn is an interactive drama survival horror video game. It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive. Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the "Butterfly Effect" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has "hundreds of endings". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game. The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.</summary>

    <summary>One of the most beloved franchises in Nintendos long history makes its glorious return in spectacular 3D! Pit of Kid Icarus fame is back in a new game designed specifically for the Nintendo 3DS system, by Masahiro Sakurai, creator of the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, and his development team at Project Sora. Kid Icarus: Uprising is a fast-paced and action-packed blend of aerial and ground-based shooting built on elegantly intuitive and streamlined play control. This follow-up to the original Kid Icarus released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987 has been at the top of gamers wish lists for years. Boasting gameplay that is easy to pick up but incredibly deep, the game is sure to satisfy novice gamers as well as fans who have been clamouring for a new installment in the franchise. The hero, Pit, teams up with Palutena, the goddess of light, who bestows on him the miracle of flight for limited stretches. With this gift, Pit soars through the skies, shooting down swarms of enemies, then alights and engages in frantic ground-based battles against Medusas underworld army. Find and collect numerous weapons and items that offer bonuses and ability boosts. Players can choose weapons before they send Pit into battle, giving them countless layers of strategies in each level. Players can choose between a basic Blade, basic Claws and a basic Orbitar weapon. Blades are well-balanced, Claws have limited reach but increase running speed and the Orbitars can shoot two shots that grow in power over distance.</summary>

    <reviews>
      <review>['Ótimo Jogo mas tem seus defeitos</review>
      <review>eu não gosto do Werehog mas consigo aceita-lo</review>
      <review>infelizmente as medalhas são um desafio grande demais pra mim.'</review>
      <review>'Re-joguei ele agora em 2023</review>
      <review>porque estava fazendo uma maratona de jogos do Sonic</review>
      <review>e ele tava na lista\n \n Sempre gostei muito do Unleashed</review>
      <review>desde que eu joguei pela primeira vez no PS2</review>
      <review>eu já concluía que aquele era meu jogo do Sonic favorito</review>
      <review>ganhei meu PS3 em 2020 e joguei 1 vez a versão de PS3 e agora joguei pela segunda vez e conclui mais ainda que ele é meu favorito da franquia\n \n 10/10'</review>
      <review>'I actually like the Werehog levels as well as the Boost levels. The bosses are all lackluster</review>
      <review>though</review>
      <review>except for the final boss. The final boss is awful.'</review>
      <review>"When I played the PS3 version of the game as my first experience with the HD version of sonic unleashed</review>
      <review>it was kinda frustrating. The medal hunting kills the pacing of the game if you are just trying to go through the levels</review>
      <review>yet the game doesn't really make an effort to tell you to slow down and find all the medals since the quotas are usually manageable on their own before they get spiked for no reason at the very end. The levels are fun as hell though</review>
      <review>I don't even really have a problem with the werehog outside of maybe a few werehog levels overstaying their welcome. The game just has a fun vibe to it</review>
      <review>I like it. The framerate on the PS3 version also sucks</review>
      <review>play the xbox version instead</review>
      <review>preferrably on series X where it runs at 60 FPS and is incredible. If you play this just make sure to collect lots of medals and do as much stuff as you can so the game won't just cockblock you from finishing it near the end."</review>
      <review>"Sonic Unleashed isn't a terrible game but there are enough gripes I had with it that made the game a slog to beat. The werehog levels while sometimes enjoyable overstayed their welcome and the combat isn't all that great. The sun &amp; moon coins were also a pain in the ass to collect for a good chunk of the game and will probably take up a good majority of your playthrough. It gets a bit easier to get the amount required to complete the game once you unlock the extra acts</review>
      <review>but unless you really pay attention as you play the levels</review>
      <review>you're going to find yourself replaying them quite a bit if you want to make progress. Eggmanland is one of the most infuriating levels I have played for quite some time. Not only does it have an absurdly big difficulty curve from every other level</review>
      <review>but the level drags on longer than the other werehog levels. Considering my lack of skill at Sonic games</review>
      <review>I'm honestly surprised I managed to beat it</review>
      <review>let alone without having to grind for extra lives. Even with that in mind it still took me over an hour to do it."</review>

      <review>'Yakuza 5 is big.'</review>
      <review>"They tried to 1-up Yakuza 4 in terms of the stuff it offers. More characters</review>
      <review>more minigames</review>
      <review>more places</review>
      <review>just more more more more more. It is impressive how much content they managed to pack into this game</review>
      <review>and while that is definitely a strength of this game</review>
      <review>it also comes to the games detriment at times IMO. Mostly in due to the fact that the game is longer than the other yakuza games</review>
      <review>and the story kinda lags behind because of it. Each character basically has their own unrelated story that ends in a cliffhanger that is resolved in the final chapter</review>
      <review>and I don't really think said cliffhanger was worth all the buildup...? idk man</review>
      <review>if you've played the series enough to make it this far you already know what you are getting yourself in for</review>
      <review>and if you for some reason want to start with this</review>
      <review>there's enough content to warrant it still being interesting i guess. The final boss also sucked</review>
      <review>and that always leaves bad aftertastes in my gamer mouth. All in all</review>
      <review>I can see what this game was going for</review>
      <review>and it wasn't BAD per se</review>
      <review>but I didn't like it personally."</review>
      <review>"This game is sort of a reverse of yakuza 4. Cause while I thought the story of 4 was incredible</review>
      <review>I thought the gameplay could be a better. This game is the opposite. The 5 characters are actually fun to play as (except 1)</review>
      <review>and the side content of this game is actually the best in the series. The 1 character that isn't fun is just lame and doesn't have very much depth to his style. Saejima actually feels good to play as in this game. I'm not sure if they just changed how he felt or I did something wrong in 4 but he's cool now. Akiyama and kiryu are akiyama and kiryu so they're obviously fun. Hakura was vey unexpected. I mean its a rhythm game breaking up an action beat em up game yet honestly it works pretty well. The side story minigames were pretty cool (especially kiryus) and a welcome addition</review>
      <review>although I didn't do them much because this game took me FOREVER. I would've liked to do them more but I was growing impatient and just wanted to finish the game. The story in this game is just okay at best. 4 does the split paths crossing into one much better and all the different stories were just kind of tiring me out at that point. There were some really sweet heartfelt moments here and there but it wasn't enough to make me 100% invested like other games. The music also wasn't as strong as the last game</review>
      <review>which isn't a dig at this games music it's still good. Just not AS good. So while the story was a little too long and convoluted for my liking</review>
      <review>the gameplay was enough to keep me hooked on this series. Another yakuza banger."</review>
      <review>"Very bloated game. Also</review>
      <review>I swear shinada's character and chapters could've been cut entirely and nothing would be lost from the main story."</review>
      <review>'What I can’t deny is that\n \n Yakuza 5\n \n delivers on one of the things I look for in these games</review>
      <review>which I will quote from my review of\n \n Lost Judgment:\n \n “the high melodrama of watching big beefy dudes brawling to protect the things and people they love.” You get that in spades here. Loads of peak emotional moments and surprisingly tender scenes featuring shirtless</review>
      <review>tattooed musclemen throwing the fuck down for each other.\n \n It’s flawed</review>
      <review>but easy to love.']</review>

    <summary>Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence continues the Metal Gear Solid series tradition of follow-up enhanced, international version releases. Subsistence's online multiplayer component, titled Metal Gear Online, consists of five tournament-style game modes, each with a capacity of up to eight players. This mode pits players, each playing as a generic soldier against each other in deathmatch battles and variations of capture the flag, using stages, items, maneuvers, and units (such as the KGB, GRU or Ocelot Unit) from the main game.</summary>

    <summary>Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island is a platform video game acting as a prequel to 1990's Super Mario World. The game casts players as Yoshi as he escorts Baby Mario through 48 levels in order to reunite him with his brother Luigi, who had been kidnapped by Baby Bowser's minions. As a Super Mario series platformer, Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while solving puzzles and collecting items. In a style new to the series, the game has a hand-drawn aesthetic and is the first to have Yoshi as its main character. The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump, produce eggs from swallowed enemies, and transform into vehicles.</summary>

      <review>['Dinossauro'</review>
      <review>"Beautiful hand-drawn-esque sprites</review>
      <review>the most jovial and joyful music you've ever heard in a game</review>
      <review>and engaging levels with unique mechanics. This game is great. It can skew a bit on the easy end but that's not a bad thing</review>
      <review>plus collecting the extras and going for 100 Points is a nice challenge. This game holds a special place to me and I have deep nostalgia for it</review>
      <review>but it's also just a solidly designed platformer."</review>
      <review>"Super Mario Land 2: Yoshi's Island is one of the best platformers Nintendo has ever made. The game controls great in a way that even the likes of its predecessor</review>
      <review>Super Mario World</review>
      <review>does not. Every part of Yoshi’s moveset just feels natural. The flutter jump is great to adjust your jumps</review>
      <review>the egg shooting is super responsive</review>
      <review>and the ground pound is so iconic that even Mario stole it for later entries in his series. The level design compliments these controls well</review>
      <review>as the exploratory nature of many of its levels put these skills to perfect use. To be fair</review>
      <review>there are a few times where instant death pits and spikes feel unwarranted</review>
      <review>but by no means is that much a dealbreaker.\n \n But not only do the controls hold up</review>
      <review>so does this game’s graphics. The children’s book art-style gives the game a sense of whimsy that can still be felt 30 years later. Additionally</review>
      <review>thanks to the Super FX chip</review>
      <review>the 3D graphics are just mindboggling and add to the already impressive graphics for the time. Even today</review>
      <review>the graphics still hold up shockingly well and is just a testament to how strong of an impression this game has on its players. Everything to the music to the enemy designs are just so delightful and full of that Nintendo charm. It’s easily one of the best platformers Nintendo has ever put out and it's clear to see why this single game spawned a franchise of its own. Now if only any of the other titles lived up to this entry…"</review>
      <review>"Even as someone who's not really a big fan of 2D platformers</review>
      <review>I absolutely adore the two Super Mario World games (I know they're only really linked by name but I like them for the same reasons). With extremely satisfying</review>
      <review>if a bit loose</review>
      <review>controls and complex but not overly tedious level design</review>
      <review>I think these two games really embody what 2D platformers should be and make me understand why people love Mario</review>
      <review>a series which I otherwise find just okay for the most part</review>
      <review>so much."</review>
      <review>"2D mario is at it's best when it's being the least 2D mario possible"</review>
      <review>"Pure art. An expressionist adventure that links the Mario and Yoshi franchises together by adding a phenomenal depth to their lore. The story is simple yet touching. The art style is some of the best I've seen by Nintendo; each frame looks like a Van Gogh painting. The levels have an excellent difficulty curve</review>
      <review>starting off with simple levels and ending with platforming challenges of an unbeknownst complexity that will test the numerous skills you've acquired with Yoshi within the six worlds. The boss fights are likely the best I've seen in any 2D platformer. The experimental 2.5D sections work remarkably well and show the great capabilities of the SNES as a console. The greatest SNES game I've played thus far</review>
      <review>the greatest prequel I've played thus far and possibly the greatest 2D platformer I've played thus far. Will be revisiting."]</review>

      <review>unfinished game is something that would sting way more if not for the fact that DMC 5 exists and apparently takes all the cool things even further than this one does. This of course doesn't change the fact that this is still an unfortunate step down from DMC 3 that clearly suffered a lot from a lack of development time along with having a plethora of weird gimmicky ideas that only serve to drag down the overall experience. On the other hand though</review>
      <review>I cannot think of many examples this is a prime example of a game that's carried so hard by one element being insanely good that it can make you somewhat overlook the fact that almost everything surrounding it doesn't really do anything for you."</review>

    <summary>Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time is the eighth Crash Bandicoot series game, though the fourth chronologically. The game retains the series' core platforming gameplay and adds new elements through the use of the Quantum Masks, who can alter levels and provide means to traverse or overcome obstacles. It also includes additional game modes for replaying levels, and the ability to control five characters, three of whom – Cortex, Dingodile, and Tawna – have their own unique gameplay and levels.</summary>

For the first time, players are put at the heart of their very own gangster movie, and let loose in a fully-realised 3 dimensional city, in which anything can happen and probably will. With a cast of hundreds, 50 plus vehicles, ranging from sports cars to ice cream trucks and from boats to buses, 3 hours of music, including opera, reggae, house, drum and bass, pop and disco, a huge array of street ready weapons and some of the seediest characters in video game history, Grand Theft Auto 3 is a sprawling epic which will show you that sometimes, crime can pay and sometimes it can pay you back. Available now for PlayStation2, Xbox, PC and Macintosh.</summary>

    <summary>Pokémon HeartGold Version and Pokémon SoulSilver Version are paired Generation IV remakes of the Generation II games Pokémon Gold and Silver. Much like how Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen revisited the Generation I story of Kanto, HeartGold and SoulSilver retell the story of Johto, with the player's starting town being New Bark Town. While the games feature several expansions in key areas, the overall plot follows the same direction as the original Gold and Silver. Some aspects exclusive to Crystal are also included. Like how FireRed and LeafGreen could link up with Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald to complete the Pokédex by trading regionally exclusive Pokémon, HeartGold and SoulSilver can link up with Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum to obtain Pokémon unavailable in Johto and Kanto (such as the Sinnoh starters) and vice versa. Kris, despite being the female counterpart of Crystal's player character, is not included as the female player character, with a new character instead taking her place. Whether she is chosen to be the player character or not, this new character will still appear in the game. The unselected protagonist will take a pseudo-rival role similar to the unselected characters of Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. The games were released on September 12, 2009 in Japan, February 4, 2010 in Korea, March 14, 2010 in North America, March 25, 2010 in Australia and March 26, 2010 in Europe (this excludes the Netherlands, Luxembourg and parts of Belgium due to an in-game save error, with the patched copies later released on April 2, 2010).</summary>

      <review>divertidos</review>
      <review>dá uma satisfação em passar</review>
      <review>e tem sentido e motivo (diferente de Immortals Fenyx que são puzzles simplesmente para ter puzzles). Em certo momento você percebe a linearidade e previsibilidade narrativa (fazer tal coisa</review>
      <review>para conseguir tal coisa</review>
      <review>para liberar tal coisa e assim enfrentar tal coisa) assim como em Immortals Fenyx</review>

      <review>divertida</review>
      <review>com sentido narrativo e a com a descoberta ao decorrer</review>
      <review>fazendo isso não ser algo chato e previsível. Um dos poucos pontos negativos são as limitações com o combate</review>
      <review>principalmente na variedade da progressão e diversidade de combate (lutar de formas diferentes). Resumindo</review>
      <review>é uma experiência incrível!'</review>

    <summary>Final Fantasy VIII is the eighth main installment in the Final Fantasy series. The gameplay makes a departure from many series standards. While it still uses the Active Time Battle system, it deviates from the series' traditional means of boosting a character's power via leveling, although levels are not completely abandoned as they were in Final Fantasy II. In addition, it does not have a Magic Point-based system for spell-casting. Instead, magic is collected, drawn, and created from items, and is used to power up the characters via the junction system.</summary>

    <summary>Presented in the style of a TV series, Alan Wake features the trademark Remedy storytelling and pulse-pounding action sequences. As players dive deeper and deeper into the mystery, they’ll face overwhelming odds, plot twists, and cliffhangers. It’s only by mastering the Fight With Light combat mechanic that they can stay one step ahead of the darkness that spreads across Bright Falls. With the body of an action game and the mind of a psychological thriller, Alan Wake’s intense atmosphere, deep and multi-layered story, and exceptionally tense combat sequences provide players with an entertaining and original gaming experience.</summary>

      <review>amazing characters and a beautiful town that shows off the amazing wilderness in Washington. My biggest complaint about the game is that the combat goes on too long in a lot of areas</review>
      <review>and would've been better if it was slightly cut down. I also felt that the non-human enemies were pretty bad</review>
      <review>but overall this game is one I'd recommend that any horror fan play. I'm so excited for Alan Wake 2</review>
      <review>I've been waiting for literal YEARS and it is almost here."</review>
      <review>"This game truly is an experience. It's priorities lie exclusively in it's mystery and storytelling. The game often uses Live-Action media (much like other Remedy titles) and heavily leans into 70s sci-fi cosmic horror such as The Twilight Zone.\n \n This games absurdity and uncanny nature elevates it's mystery and creates an atmosphere that is completely unforgettable</review>
      <review>not quite horror but certainly still unnerving.\n \n The protagonist Alan Wake's inner monologue add so much to this authors venture into his own nightmares. He regularly dissects his situations and plot points in a fitting way for his characters.\n \n There are several side characters</review>
      <review>but these characters often feel plot reliant and lifeless.\n \n This game is so close to being a 5/5 but is held back by it's core gameplay loop</review>
      <review>while it is serviceable</review>
      <review>it devolves into becoming tedious and a chore by the final chapters.\n \n All this aside</review>

      <review>"Played the DS version recently</review>
      <review>not a game that I have a significant amount of opinions on but enough to log for myself. It's quite different from the console version in a lot of ways</review>
      <review>the level design is altered I assume to fit the DS' limitations? I don't know anything about technical stuff for consoles so just a guess. They compensate for this with far more characters than the main console versions</review>
      <review>including some that wouldn't even appear in the follow up to this on console either</review>
      <review>like Azrael and Zsasz. As one of the earlier Lego games of its kind (along with Complete Saga and Indiana Jones)</review>
      <review>the hub world is just kind of there in both versions rather than the interesting stuff that would show up later (originally on the sequel to this one)</review>
      <review>and as such once you've beaten the main games you will get caught on a fair whack of grinding if you don't have the cash to pick up the keys which are required for a lot of free play stuff. Essentially it's a fun mindless playthrough but once you've beaten the story it isn't the most engaging to 100%. Though i'm sure I did it on console as a child</review>
      <review>and I also used to know some of the cheats off by heart. Good game and a fun reminisce."</review>

      <review>except this time batman-flavored. This game was the closest WB ever got to getting me interested in batman</review>
      <review>as the diverse roster of villains and unique levels really caught kid mes attention. I probably enjoyed this the most out of any TT lego game as a kid</review>

      <review>but the story didn't click with me. I wish I liked this one more than I do. If you like SMT</review>
      <review>you have probably already played this game."</review>
      <review>'one of the worst port ever'</review>
      <review>'better than pc port'</review>
      <review>'El juego me ha gustado mucho</review>
      <review>lo único que habia jugado de la saga Shin Megami era el spin off de Persona 3 y lo dejé porque me aburria de tener que subir los vinculos con los otros personajes porque eran conversación banales tipo "¿qué chicas te gustan?" o "¿me sienta bien esta ropa?"\n \n Pero este juego trata sobre el fin del mundo y el nacimiento de otro</review>
      <review>por lo que solo hay unos 5 humanos y el resto de habitantes son demonios</review>
      <review>almas o maniquís. Además los encuentros con los otros humanos se sienten como fortuitos y suelen hablar sobre sus miedos</review>
      <review>sueños y la visión de su mundo ideal y los problemas que ellos ven con el mundo actual. En resumen tienen menos dialogo que en la saga Persona pero dicen cosas mucho más interesantes</review>
      <review>(bajo mi punto de vista).\n \n El sistema de combate es por turnos y tiene cosas que me gustan y cosas que no.\n \n Tu equipo esta formado por tu avatar y los demonios que hayas reclutado</review>
      <review>los demonios pueden morir en combate y puedes llamar a otro que tengas para sustituirlo</review>
      <review>lo unico que gasta un turno. Si se muere tu personaje se acaba la partida y tienes que cargar del último puntonde guardado. Hay ataques de daño que puede ser fisico o magico</review>
      <review>y los magicos hay de muchos elementos distintos</review>
      <review>y también hay ataques de aumentar tus estadísticas</review>
      <review>bajar las del rival</review>
      <review>provocar problemas de estado y curar tu salud y/o maná.\n \n Las acciones que tienes para atacar en tu turno depende de la cantidad de demonios que tengas en el equipo</review>
      <review>máximo 4 acciones</review>
      <review>pero pueden aumentar hasta 8 si haces ataques eficaces o criticos</review>
      <review>pero también puedes perder acciones si fallas ataques o haces ataques inmunes para tu rivales.\n \n Y uno de los problemas es que siento que el combate se centra mucho en aumentar tu evasión y reducir la precisión del rival para que el rival falle y asi tu puedas pegar muchas más veces. Lo bueno es que desde la primera zona hay demonios que tienen sukukaja o sukunda que permiten justo eso.\n \n Tu personaje va aprendiendo tecnicas conforme aumenta de nivel y consigue distintos magatamas</review>
      <review>así que es bueno porque tiene mucha personalización</review>
      <review>lo malo que los slots de habilidades pasivas y los ataques se comparten por lo que no puedes tener una gran variedad de ataques elementales y habilidades pasivas interesantes. Una cosa que no estoy seguro si se puede hacer o no es recordar movimientos y habilidades que podías haber tenido pero una vez que las has descartado ya no las puedes volver a obtener.\n \n Los demonios también aprenden ataques aumentando sus niveles solo que están limitados a unos pocos ataques</review>
      <review>para tener los que tu quieras es mediante la fusión de demonios con los ataques necesarios.\n \n Otro problema es sobre las fusiones</review>
      <review>me gustaria que fuera más intuitivo o que explicaran en que se basan que demonios hay que fusionar para sacar el que tú quieres</review>
      <review>porque me ha pasado que yo queria sacar al Trompetista que es el menora de más alto nivel (78) pero para eso tenia que fusionar a Pazuzu y a Dionisio que tenia ambos al nivel cincuenta alto</review>
      <review>mientras tanto los demonios de nivel 70 que tenía con ninguna combinación lo podia sacar.\n \n Pero salvo eso me gusta que puedan heredar habilidades y si sacrifiques a un tercer demonio puedes también heredar sus habilidades además de sacar al nuevo demonio con uno o varios niveles más alto.\n \n Por cierto las habilidades de recarga de maná y absorbe maná me parecen las mejores porque te permite llegar al jefe de una mazmorra con los puntos de salud y maná al maximo sin tener que gastar objetos.\n \n Las mazmorras me gustan la mayoria el diseño que tienen a pesar de tener un estilo muy psicodelico</review>
      <review>lo que no me gusta es que algunas se vuelven muy laberínticas porque ponen cosas como teletransportaciones y tienes que aprendertelos de memoria. También hay algunas que tienen unos puzzles y no soy fan de los puzzles asi que eso no me gusta mucho.']</review>

      <review>["My favorite puzzle game of all time and the most satisfying Plat I've ever gotten. This game fits so perfectly with how my brain operates and scratches an itch that no other game has managed to satisfy since. It's quite literally the perfect puzzle game for me and if I could wipe it from my brain so I could do it all again</review>
      <review>I would.\n \n\n\n Disclaimer: These are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 7 years ago:"</review>
      <review>"Wow. I'm so surprised to see the negative reviews for this</review>
      <review>because its easily my favourite puzzle game ever. Its actual genius game design</review>
      <review>with a simple enough puzzle concept that is built upon and built upon to create an open world that is just amazing to explore and unlock piece by piece."</review>
      <review>'The only way to beat this game is to “witness” a walkthrough for it. Just like Braid</review>
      <review>this game enjoys the smell of its own farts way too much and thinks it’s way smarter than it really is. If this wasn’t riding the legacy of Braid</review>
      <review>the witness would’ve had no witnesses to play it.'</review>
      <review>'i never want to touch this game again'</review>
      <review>'I played this first when it came out and I enjoyed it for a bit then got tired of it so I looked at a walkthrough to still see the ending and it felt like some pretentious shit (some "branlette intellectuelle" as we say in french) so I just moved on.\n \n Came back to it a few years later and I loved it. I\'m amazed by the puzzles</review>
      <review>illusions</review>
      <review>and how everything is taught to you without any text. I love the beauty and calm of the island.\n \n The endings are still a bit of a "branlette intellectuelle" to me haha. But that secret lecture about easter eggs was super interesting !'</review>

    <summary>Sonic Adventure 2 is the sequel to Sonic Adventure. It was the final Sonic game for the Dreamcast after Sega discontinued the console. Two new playable characters were introduced, Shadow and Rouge, who would go on to become two of the most recurring characters in the Sonic series. The story features good vs evil: Sonic, Tails and Knuckles attempt to save the world, while Shadow, Doctor Eggman and Rouge attempt to conquer it. The levels are divided into three gameplay styles: fast-paced platforming for Sonic and Shadow, multi-directional shooting for Tails and Eggman, and action-exploration for Knuckles and Rouge.</summary>

    <summary>The gluttonous King Dedede has stolen all of the food from the inhabitants of Dream Land for a midnight feast, so Kirby, a resident of Dream Land, goes to retrieve the food and stop Dedede. Kirby's Dream Land plays like other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games: Kirby must use various natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.</summary>

    <summary>Resident Evil 2 is a sequel to the first Resident Evil title. Like the previous game in the series, Resident Evil 2 is a 3D action-adventure using three-dimensional polygon characters over two-dimensional pre-rendered backgrounds, with the action viewed through a variety of cinematic fixed camera angles in each room. Players can choose to play as one of two possible characters, each goes through the same initial scenario but with differences in the type of weaponry they find and the people they meet along the way.</summary>

      <review>['A product of the time</review>
      <review>but the tank controls work perfectly with the fixed camera angles and the game is designed well around this fact. The design translates to tension in gameplay and item management is so fun and challenging. Always fun to speedrun.'</review>

    <summary>This is not a story of heroes. Since time immemorial, warriors called musha have ruled the battlefield, granted supernatural power by their enchanted suits of armor - tsurugi. Minato Kageaki is one such musha, driven by duty to don his crimson armor and challenge the greatest evils of an age. But though madmen and tyrants fall to his blade, never will he claim that his battle is right. For the tsurugi he wields is cursed Muramasa, which five centuries ago brought ruin to the land, and innocent blood is the price it demands in exchange for its terrible might. "Where there are demons, I slay them. Where there are saints, I slay them." These words are an oath, the unbreakable Law binding him to his armor. But they also tell the story of his past, and of the future to come.</summary>

This version has motion control compatibility for the sword and pointer controls for the menus, the bow and the boomerang.

The change in layout was meant to adapt Link's usually left-handed design to right-handed people, given the motion controls.</summary>

    <summary>Prepare for a different story set in the same universe as Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Shez, a mercenary whose team was decimated by Byleth in battle, joins the military academy of Garreg Mach Monastery and becomes a student in one of three classes, each including students from one of the three nations of the continent of Fódlan. Like in Three Houses, the game allows players to decide which class to join, leading to different story paths and playable characters.</summary>

    <summary>DmC: Devil May Cry is the fifth game in the hack-and-slash third-person action series and the first not largely developed by Capcom. This title is a reimagining of the series, with the same protagonist Dante, but set in an alternate universe. The Dante in this game is very different from before, doing away with the trademark white hair and altering the main character as well as the game's tone with a much more Western influence. The gameplay is still largely identical as Dante engages many opponents with a fast fighting style, stringing together combos and hits in quick succession.</summary>

      <review>['Dmc Devil may cry é um jogo bem sólido</review>
      <review>com uma das melhores gameplays da série</review>
      <review>e as melhores e mais divertidas seções de plataforma. A gameplay é muito boa</review>
      <review>com muitos combos fluidos e variedade da armas</review>
      <review>como parte fundamental dessa estrutura a troca rápida de armas durante um combo. Porém mesmo sendo um game muito gostoso de jogar</review>
      <review>os inimigos não acompanham essa fluidez toda e acabam sendo na esmagadora maioria do jogo apenas sacos de pancadas de combos</review>
      <review>o que abaixa e muito a dificuldade do game</review>
      <review>o que pode desagradar alguns ( incluindo eu). No geral embora conte com um ou outro inimigo interessante</review>
      <review>no geral os inimigos não tem metade do carisma da série principal</review>
      <review>o que tbm se reflete um pouco nos poucos chefes do game</review>
      <review>na qual dois em especial são bem criativos e legais</review>
      <review>porém os outros não tem o mesmo tempero que a série clássica. Quanto a história aoesar de um Reboot</review>
      <review>dá pra perceber o cuidado de contar uma história de início mais consistente e uniforme</review>
      <review>diferente da série principal que é uma bagunça tremenda na questão do enredo e cronologia. A história do jogo funciona passando um ar demoníaco mais sujo e pé no chão do que o padrão anime da série original</review>
      <review>o que nesse jogo caiu muito bem. Porém acredito que o maior responsável pelo rage que esse jogo sofreu seja seu protagonista Dante</review>
      <review>que não tem 20% do carisma do protagonista original</review>
      <review>e somada a péssima estratégia de marketing usada na promoção desse jogo na época</review>
      <review>apenas reforçaram a aversão ao personagem</review>
      <review>o que infelizmente se refletiu na repercussão do game. Porém infelizmente fico curioso pra saber quais seriam os rumos da história a partir desse game</review>
      <review>os quais eram promissores.\n \n No geral</review>
      <review>se você gosta do gênero hack n slash e deseja uma experiência extremamente gostosa de jogar</review>

      <review>'Melhor DmC'</review>
      <review>"(Played before 2023)\n \n Good music</review>
      <review>fun to kill demons. That somes up all the positives. I hate Dante's new design</review>
      <review>I hate the 'teleported into demon world' because it makes every level feel exactly the same</review>
      <review>and the platforming wasn't that interesting. This was the first DMC game I played</review>
      <review>and probably why I've never really gotten into the series."</review>
      <review>'Install an "El Donte spanish sombrero dante" mod for this shit and play it with a friend</review>

    <summary>Dragon Age: Origins is a third-person role-playing game described as a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights franchises. Players create their own character by customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class. Combat is in real time with the ability to pause at any moment: tactical options include an editor which allows the player to give the AI detailed instructions on how to behave in every possible situation. Although the main storyline is the same for every character created, the game features six unique prologues, two for each race. Dragon Age: Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system.</summary>

Most of them are very great with a lot of intriguing moral and political choices to navigate. The cast is great and they all bounce off each other incredibly well. It\'s always a treat seeing how each will react to different choices on new playthroughs.\n \n If there\'s one thing that really does suck about the game is the lack of support this game gets from EA.

    <summary>Xenoblade Chronicles follows Shulk and his band of friends as they search for answers about the mysterious "Monado" sword and defend their homeland from violent robotic creatures known as the Mechon. The game contains an open world design and strongly emphasizes exploration due to the world's large size. The game was very well received by critics, with many citing it as a great example of innovation and improvement in Japanese role-playing video games. The game has spawned a sub-series of the larger "Xeno" series, including Xenoblade Chronicles X (Wii U) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (Switch).</summary>

    <summary>The Forgotten City is a mystery adventure game of exploration and deduction, and a re-imagining of the critically acclaimed mod of the same name. Combat is an option, but violence will only get you so far. Only by questioning an intertwined community of colorful characters, cleverly exploiting the time loop, and making difficult moral choices can you hope to solve this epic mystery. Here, your decisions matter. The fate of the city is in your hands.</summary>

      <review>['well written. voice acting could be better. got to "ending 2"</review>
      <review>but not itching to get the other endings.'</review>
      <review>'Wow'</review>
      <review>'Switch'</review>
      <review>'If you enjoy puzzles (though not overly complex or difficult ones) and history this is a great game. I don\'t care for history that much but even I was intruiged; the history was presented in managable bites that it didn\'t get boring. The "action" scenes were just enough to keep things lively for a bit.\n \n The game is beautiful. The characters could use a bit more depth but good. Can\'t really see any flaws to this game if you are interested in a chill game with historical story.'</review>
      <review>"A number of time loop games have come out the last few years and it's an appealing mechanic. Doing things over till you get things right is very much baked into concept of video games. The Forgotten City does it really well. It avoids repetition by allowing you to keep any item you pick up between loops and at the start of the loop</review>
      <review>you're able to tell the NPC that greets you to do some of the tasks for you. It's a fun puzzle game and it's satisfying to work out how to solve everyone's problem. I really did enjoy the story; it felt very Star Trek. I'm always down for a Roman aesthethic and I liked the thematic link between the player builing up knowledge based on past loops and how civilizations like the Romans were built upon past civilizations. I do want to say good for the guy who made a popular Skyrim mod and found success building it into its own game. Those are always nice stories to hear."</review>

    <summary>As a demon army besieges his village, a young ninja ventures through a cursed world, to deliver a scroll paramount to his clan's survival. Leveraging players expectations as a core game design ingredient, The Messenger is first presented as an 8-bit action platformer with a simple story, that unravels into an epic time traveling tale, eventually revealing itself as a 16-bit Metroidvania game packed with replay value and deadpan humor.</summary>

      <review>I found it extremely difficult</review>
      <review>but I had little experience back then. For the longest time now</review>
      <review>I've wanted to properly go back and play The Messenger again</review>
      <review>to see if I've improved.\n \n This game is still absolutely amazing. I forgot how good the music is</review>
      <review>playing the game on a controller this time felt amazing</review>
      <review>and I would not be surprised if that was what removed a lot of the difficulty. Bosses are so fun</review>

      <review>the humor is fun and doesn't take away from any of the game. The fact that you're never told of it being a Metroidvania until halfway through</review>
      <review>and how the time periods are represented by how many bits are used. It's amazing.\n \n Now</review>

    <summary>Jet Set Radio HD is the latest remaster in a string of Dreamcast "hits" to see new life on download platforms, but Sega has been insistent that they've learned its lessons. The publisher has emphasized how hard it's trying to get things right this time, and for many, it couldn't have chosen a better game. Jet Set Radio was part of Sega's onslaught of new properties with an emphasis on flash and style during the second wave of Dreamcast software, but it might be one of the more obscure. It's a game that almost everyone has heard of, but I think few have actually played. This was remedied somewhat with 2002's Xbox sequel Jet Set Radio Future. Unlike Sonic Adventure or the arcade hit Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio HD is the chance for many to finally play a game they've only heard about. Nostalgia has the side effect of high expectations though, and Jet Set Radio HD just can't meet them. While the flash and style of Jet Set Radio HD remains untouched and unvarnished by a dozen years of progress, the rest of it can't stand up to scrutiny. Squirrely controls, camera catastrophes, and nonsensical level design make Jet Set Radio HD a better memory than game.</summary>

    <summary>Tactics Ogre, crown jewel of the tactical role-playing genre, is reborn! Based on the 2010 release, the game features improved graphics and sound, as well as updated game design, bringing to life a new Tactics Ogre that remains true to its roots.</summary>

      <review>['I\'m at the end of the game but didn\'t finish the final "dungeon". I did</review>
      <review>however</review>
      <review>complete all of the shrines and a decent chunk of the Palace of the Dead. Everyone has Winged Rings</review>
      <review>so even the AI can complete most of that dungeon at this point.\n \n I like most of the gameplay improvements/changes</review>
      <review>but the in-battle cards ultimately didn\'t really improve or sour the experience beyond cluttering the battlefield. I\'m still absolutely too stupid to understand the intricacies of the story</review>
      <review>or maybe I just find it too much like a boring historical drama to retain.'</review>
      <review>'Venir de Fire Emblems Engage a esto es todo un viaje porque es pasar de un reloj de precisiÃ³n suizo en lo jugable con historia mediocre pero simple a un juego con una historia que intenta ser mucho mÃ¡s de lo que es y una jugabilidad que pfff.'</review>
      <review>"Much has been said about the quality and customizability of the combat (it's fantastic)</review>
      <review>but one of my favorite things about the Tactics Ogre is how even though the end results of your decisions might be virtually identical</review>
      <review>the writing is elegant enough to obfuscate that into really feeling like player choice is important. Make a decision early on</review>
      <review>and character X will leave you</review>
      <review>disgusted by your actions; choose the opposite choice</review>
      <review>and that same character leaves you - this time</review>
      <review>revealing that no matter what choice you made</review>
      <review>they'd disagree with it</review>
      <review>because they\n \n hate your fucking guts\n \n . It may feel kind of dishonest</review>
      <review>but frankly? That's consistent writing</review>
      <review>and I respect it."</review>
      <review>"I like the idea of what the systems are trying to do</review>
      <review>but I feel that the implementation is sloppy and dated. It's an incredibly complex game</review>
      <review>but you must dive deep into the warren report to discover that</review>
      <review>removing all sense of casualness from the game. At first</review>
      <review>I thought the level cap was a neat idea</review>
      <review>but even without grinding I ended up spending multiple battles at the cap</review>
      <review>constantly fighting an uphill battle against opponents that were perpetually stronger and better equipped than my rag-tag army. To me</review>
      <review>this comes across as a lazy attempt at raising the difficulty that subsequently forces me into a box of playing the 'right' solution</review>
      <review>suppressing creativity in one's approach as you rely more on exploiting the AI</review>
      <review>creating a much more stagnant</review>
      <review>repetitive and aggravating experience that becomes an entirely different kind of grind. What I saw of the story was intriguing</review>
      <review>but it's nowhere near enough to make me want to slog through the rest. The grind has a certain uniqueness that allows tiny incremental gains even at the level cap</review>
      <review>but I can't shake the feeling that this just isn't respecting my time. Otherwise</review>
      <review>it looks and sounds great. If you're looking for a tactical RPG that you can just pick up and play casually</review>
      <review>this certainly isn't it</review>
      <review>but if you're up for a challenge and have the time to spare</review>
      <review>then I'd still say you should give it a go."</review>
      <review>'Gameâ€™s fine. 30 hours in</review>
      <review>early on in Chapter 4.'</review>

    <summary>From Valve (the creators of Counter-Strike, Half-Life and more) comes Left 4 Dead, a co-op action horror game for the PC and Xbox 360 that casts up to four players in an epic struggle for survival against swarming zombie hordes and terrifying mutant monsters. Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each "movie" is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives. New technology dubbed "the AI Director" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie. Addictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them.</summary>

    <summary>Drakengard 3 transports players to a medieval world where six goddess-like sisters known as "Intoners" have brought peace to the earth with their power to manipulate magic through song. Harmony is disrupted, however, when the eldest sister, Zero, attempts to murder her younger sisters with the help of her dragon companion, Mikhail. As the story progresses, players find themselves in a battle to unravel the mystery of Zero and learn her true intentions. A prequel to the original Drakengard, Drakengard 3 features the series’ signature brand of action, pitting players against hordes of fiends and foes in remorseless hack-and-slash ground combat, and then sending them soaring for pitched aerial battles on the back of the dragon Mikhail.</summary>

    <summary>Assassin's Creed Revelations presents the most immersive experience available in the series to date and the culmination of Ezio's adventure. In Assassin's Creed Revelations, master assassin Ezio Auditore walks in the footsteps of his legendary mentor, Altair, on a journey of discovery and revelation. It is a perilous path - one that will take Ezio to Constantinople, the heart of the Ottoman Empire, where a growing army of Templars threatens to destabilize the region. In addition to Ezio's award-winning story, the acclaimed online multiplayer experience from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood returns; refined and expanded, with more modes, more maps and more characters that allow players to test their assassin skills against others from around the world. The latest chapter in the Assassin's Creed saga also includes revolutionary gameplay, allowing players to manipulate the construct of Desmond's memories and the Animus to decipher the mysteries of his past and gain insight into the future.</summary>

      <review>'I find myself looking up blearily from this game and wondering where the last two weeks are so have gone... something about this game just absolutely scratched the itch in my brain that made me want to clean everything! Something about the little "ding" when you\'ve completely washed something is super satisfying</review>
      <review>as is taking a grimy looking house or playground or what have you and seeing it slowly become a nice</review>
      <review>brightly-colored environment. There are definitely some flaws in the gameplay and presentation</review>
      <review>though; the fact that you can\'t rotate equipment as far as I can tell makes using it unnecessarily clunky</review>
      <review>and I wish there were different color options for the Dirt Sense because orange occasionally blends in a little too well to be able to see it in some environments. And then sometimes it\'s a little too light to be able to detect and you have to just keep washing something until the game tells you it\'s clean... but regardless</review>
      <review>I still thought it was a very good time accelerator. Seriously</review>
      <review>it makes time fly like nothing else when you\'re listening to podcasts or watching something on the side. And I still have the DLC yet to go!'</review>
      <review>'Powerwash simulator is definitely a game thats hard to properly reccomend and harder to rate. I think it\'s definitely one of those "look at it and you will know immediately if you would vibe with it or not" type of games. The whole game involves you and hopefully one friend powerwashing various dirt-coated things until they are clean once again. That\'s pretty much it. It is exactly what it says on the tin. If you find something like that boring and braindead</review>
      <review>then you should probably steer clear. If you find it satisfying and theraputic</review>
      <review>then you should def give it a try. It makes a good "VC game" where you don\'t have to put much thought into what you are doing and have something for your hands to do while chatting with friends about things. I do wish the main campaign could be played with more than 2 players maximum though. All in all</review>
      <review>I enjoyed my time with this but it\'s definitely not something for everyone.']</review>

      <review>'this games ost is so good it carried the whole experience so much for me'</review>
      <review>'its not always the most interesting</review>
      <review>but this is a very under-rated game. it has quite a few unique ideas</review>
      <review>its level design is fun</review>
      <review>and the animated cutscenes are beautiful even now. its not much about speed</review>
      <review>however. it plays more like a giant pinball machine instead. its not quite as fun</review>
      <review>but its still great. very colorful worlds</review>
      <review>and a GOATED soundtrack. yeah</review>
      <review>this is great'</review>
      <review>"I do not like this game's vibe very much</review>
      <review>but the music and visuals are great. Sonic Boom is a classic song. And the anime cutscenes are dope</review>
      <review>but you knew that."</review>
      <review>"the most divisive of the classic sonic games and im right in the middle of that fence. The OST goes hard no matter what region you play in</review>
      <review>with the japanese/european soundtrack giving more funky vibes whereas the american version gives off a lot of atmospheric serious vibes. Gameplaywise this game is a very directionless little game</review>
      <review>since there is this time travel mechanic they got going on where you have to go to the past to fix the future</review>
      <review>but you can also collect time stones to get the good futures which makes the whole going into the past thing kinda pointless since its significantly easier to just go for the time stones instead</review>
      <review>but then the levels are designed to be wide and open so you can explore them which defeats the purpose of that if you are just gunning it to the end</review>
      <review>and can you see now why I said it feels directionless? No matter how you play it</review>
      <review>it's still defintely worth a play for sure and I'd reccomend it pretty highly just for the experience</review>
      <review>since you don't get vibes like this in a sonic game that often."</review>
      <review>'So…whilst they were making sonic 2 over in America with yuji naka</review>
      <review>the rest of the original sonic team were left in japan to work on a different sonic game for sega’s next business venture…the sega cd…of night trap fame of course.']</review>

The character in front handles the driving duties, while the character in the rear doles out damage with six normal items and eight special items that only specific characters can use. Get ready for some intense multiplayer mayhem with your favorite characters, including Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, Peach, Bowser, and Koopa.</summary>

    <summary>Bubble Dreamer, Rayman, his best friend Globox, and some Teensy friends are chilling out at the Bubble Dreamer's resting grounds, the Snoring Tree. However, their snoring disturbs an old granny from the Land of the Livid Dead, who retaliates by sending an evil army of horrendous creatures and the Darktoons across the world, capturing the Electoons that inhabit the world, imprisoning Betilla the Nymph and her sisters, and plunging the Glade into chaos. As a result, the ensuing disaster causes the Bubble Dreamer to go crazy and have nightmares. Although they are captured, Rayman and his friends are able to escape the Darktoons. They are then tasked by the Magician to gather enough Electoons to cure the Bubble Dreamer and restore the Glade of Dreams. Their efforts to locate the Electoons allow them to gain access to the various lands of the Glade, rescuing the Nymphs along the way.</summary>

To progress through the linear story, players take on enemies throughout levels. The game features interactive cutscenes which transition seamlessly into continuing gameplay; there are no loading screens across gameplay and cutscenes.</summary>

    <summary>The tough puff Kirby is back for a 4-player* platforming adventure. Copy enemies’ abilities and use their power to attack with a sword, wield a whip, and float with a parasol. You can also laser blast with the new Mecha Copy Ability that makes a series debut! The extra muscle will be handy in finding missing pieces for Magolor’s ship, which crash landed on Planet Popstar. Float and fight along with friends on the same system, where each player can control another Kirby or one of Kirby’s iconic friends like King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Bandana Waddle Dee.</summary>

    <summary>Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is a role-playing video game developed by Atlus, and chronologically the third installment in the Persona series. Eternal Punishment takes place in the fictional Japanese city of Sumaru, and is a direct sequel to Persona 2: Innocent Sin. Taking place a year after Innocent Sin, the game follows reporter Maya Amamo as she investigates the Joker Curse, a malign phenomenon where people's wishes and rumors are coming true and causing chaos. During her investigations, she and others who join her gain the ability to summon Personas, personified aspects of their personalities. The gameplay features turn-based battle gameplay, where characters use their Personas in battle against demons, and a separate Rumor system, where rumors spread around the city can influence events in the characters' favor.</summary>

Battlefront II, however, includes elements and missions from Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, as well as enhanced aspects of gameplay including space combat and the ability to play as Jedi characters or other heroes. With brand new space combat, playable Jedi characters, and over 16 all new battlefronts, Star Wars Battlefront II gives you more ways than ever before to play the classic Star Wars battles any way you want.</summary>

    <summary>A century of Transylvanian tranquility is about to come to a shocking end. Once again the mortifying screams of helpless villagers shake the ground as they huddle against new nightmarish horrors unleashed by the Duke of Darkness, Count Dracula. And this time he has a tombstone with your name on it, Simon Belmont. You must descend into Castle of the Undead and its gruesome ground, accompanied by the most chilling sound effects to ever tingle your spine. Inside, a freshly dug 11 levels maze features the treacherous Terrace of Terror, the dangerous Rotating Dungeon, the Sunken Ruins of Lost Spirits, torture chambers and creature filled caves. Use your whip like a grappling hook and swing past hundreds of traps and a host of ghost freaks, living corpses and hidden goblins. All while dodging or destroying the unpredictable spitting lizards, carnivorous coffins, and more. Find the concealed weapons needed to defeat everything from eerie phantoms to haunted furniture. Then prepare to find yourself face-to-thing with hideous torments like the Tongue Lasher, the Darkest Knight, the Bone-Afide Horseman and the Granite Crusher. When your nerves get shot, use your password and take a breather. But forge on, Simon Belmont, because if you though Dracula was down for the count, he's only just begun to fright!</summary>

      <review>["Sometimes considered a remake of the first game in the series (I strongly disagree) this is still to this day my absolute favorite Castlevania game. It was also a fantastic display of the Super Famicom's capabilities</review>
      <review>using its graphical and audio features wisely. The one little critic would be that since the whip is overpowered</review>
      <review>the secondary weapons are not that useful. But that's very much it."</review>
      <review>'wow the super nintendo really got shafted for castlevania. the other members of the big 3 16-bit machines got bangers while this one is just... uhhhhhhh it\'s fine.\n \n i don\'t think the 8-directional whip an inherently bad idea. especially not after a god-tier game like CVIII that would leave any series in a "where do we go from here?" state. the problem is SCVIV totally fails to build challenges around it. the best it comes up with for most of the game is placing enemies slightly below the player that are best dealt with by tediously bouncing the whip around</review>
      <review>and some preeeetty bad grappling hook platforming sections. the death and dracula fights actually make some decent use of it but it\'s way too little too late. and that would all be one thing but they seemed aware that the game would be way way easier than its NES predecessors so they filled the back half of the game with an actually obnoxious amount of tedious instant death traps. where the late-game levels of CVI and CVIII are back-breaking but extremely satisfying to piece together (the medusa+knight hallway is a prsitine example) SCVIV really feels like work near the end. the finesse just isn\'t there.\n \n presentation wise the game punches unbelievably far above its weight as a near-launch title. it really is stunning</review>
      <review>i just wish it could play as good as it looks and sounds.'</review>
      <review>'First castlevania I finished all I have to say was it was nice'</review>
      <review>"medium take alert; this games just aight. I was expecting this crazy big fancy masterpiece of a game that people talk about when they discuss the best super nintendo games of all time</review>
      <review>but eh I guess I wasn't really feeling this one too much compared to other games like rondo of blood or castlevania 3. Yeah you can change directions in mid-air and whip in multiple directions but I felt like the level design was kinda forgettable (with some exceptional mode7 gimmick levels) and the OST was more of this atmospheric type thing they had going on instead of the more upbeat type of sound i'd normally expect with castlevania. I think the game plays well though and maybe if you like a different flavor of castlevania you'd like this more than I would</review>
      <review>but idk man this one just didn't live up to the expectations for me personally. it's just aight."</review>
      <review>'Kinda mediocre when put up against the rest of the series. Now a ton of interesting levels. Mostly long hallways and staircases. Not even that challenging either aside from the obvious one hit kill traps they set up.'</review>
      <review>'each half star comes from each direction i can attack in because FUCK only being able to hit right in front of me']</review>

    <summary>Brothers is presented from a third-person view overlooking the two brothers. The brothers are moved individually by two thumbsticks on the controller. The controller triggers also cause the respective brother to interact with the game world, such as talking to a non-player character or grabbing onto a ledge or object. The older brother is the stronger of the two and can pull levers or boost his younger brother to higher spaces, while the younger one can pass between narrow bars. The player progresses by manipulating the two brothers at the same time to complete various puzzles, often requiring the player to manipulate both brothers to perform differing functions (such as one distracting a hostile non-player character while the other makes their way around). Should either brother fall from a great height or get injured, the game restarts at a recent checkpoint. All of the in-game dialogue is spoken in a fictional language, thus the story is conveyed through actions, gestures and expressions.</summary>

    <summary>GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and based on the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. It was exclusively released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["I've never seen a James Bond movie. The only intake of 007 media is from this game. And to be honest</review>
      <review>until I played through the entire campaign on Switch Online</review>
      <review>the only experience I had with this game was from glimpses of my cousins playing through the campaign or from the short bursts of multiplayer they'd allowed me to participate in. Playing through the game</review>
      <review>I've realized how important this game truly is to the higher FPS canon. Non-linear levels based on objectives along with fast-paced gunplay. Varied weaponry that feels so good to maul down enemy combatants as they stalk you relentlessly. A smooth yet intense soundtrack from Grant Kirkhope. The dedication to its source material. Goldeneye is still one of the best movie to game adaptations in history and people who complain about the controls are missing the point. Yes</review>
      <review>there are frustrating aspects to the gameplay</review>
      <review>but when you get used to it</review>
      <review>you realize you can gundown enemies with one hand and sip a glass of whiskey on the rocks in the other; letting the left trigger and the auto aim do the rest. I could’ve made a shaken not stirred martini reference but I don’t know any Bond references that weren’t made in this game. I thought the Moonraker and Golden Gun were from this movie! They aren’t from Goldeneye??!! That's cool that they added so many references to the whole franchise though even though it was lost on me even now."</review>
      <review>'Really wanted to give this game a chance</review>
      <review>but by todays FPS standards the controls have aged terribly.'</review>
      <review>'extraordinarily okay game</review>
      <review>misogyny is so back'</review>
      <review>'6 features GoldenEye still gets right like almost no shooter and movie adaption today:'</review>
      <review>'This game certainly has a legendary status for not only being a catalyst of console FPS games but also for its phenomenal multiplayer where its just plain fun to blast away at your friends and scream at em for screenpeeking and picking oddjob. I had owned this game for years and not even touched the singleplayer mode</review>
      <review>so I finally got around to doing the actual campaign and its aight. The controls take some time to get used to for sure but once i got over the learning curve it was very smooth sailing. I think my main gripe with the game is just that I don\'t know how the game wanted me to play the whole time. Since the game was initially designed to be a gallery shooter before the devs switched to an FPS</review>
      <review>the levels are designed with a lot of "choke points" where there are a lot of enemies and one way to proceed. Naturally</review>
      <review>especially considering this game is a james bond game</review>
      <review>the correct move would be to cautiously take out all the enemies before proceeding to the next area. Unfortunately the game continues to spawn enemies infinitely if you decide to stay in one spot too long</review>
      <review>so sometimes a better play would be to throw caution to the wind and just run through everyone blasting them like its doom. Due to the fact that it\'s hard to tell how the game wants you to play for each level plus the fact that each level is rather open and nonlinear</review>
      <review>allowing the player to get lost frequently</review>
      <review>it all blends together to create a rather unbalanced gameplay experience. The soundtrack is good</review>
      <review>and graphically the environments are very nice looking on the N64</review>
      <review>with far draw distances for the system and not too much slowdown. Once again</review>
      <review>the multiplayer is some of the most fun you can have on the N64. All in all</review>
      <review>great with friends</review>
      <review>eh by yourself.'</review>

      <review>WarioWare knew how to show its absurdness and uniquely replayable gameplay. Though this one falls on the shorter side and has a few minigames that are just too sudden to beat in the first try (later entries fix these issues)</review>

      <review>an oil field</review>

      <review>["Gravity rush 2 is really jsut the first game</review>
      <review>but so much bigger. A huge world with new abilities that relate to how you use your shifting allow better use of combat. New characters fill the world with more personality as we learn about Kat's origins. Sony I beg you to make a 3rd game"</review>
      <review>"Such a beautiful sequel to one of my favourite games. I really enjoyed all the improvements in terms of mission design (especially the side missions) and characters. I didn't like the stealth segments but I still appreciate the variety of the gameplay. The story was pretty good with a decently written villain. The gameplay itself (the gravity shifting) was as good as in the first game. You still have to get used to the controls but it feels so cool when you're able to e.g. fall upwards which is so awesome."</review>

    <summary>An exploration-driven 3D metroidvania/first-person shooter hybrid and sequel to Metroid Prime (2002) in which Samus lands on Aether, an intricate planet torn into light and dark versions of itself, to help its remaining inhabitants defend against the invaders from its dark incarnation by traversing both the light and dark worlds, acquiring new power-ups and braving oppressive environments.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["One of the best Metroid games. Every issue I had with Prime 1 was fixed. Better bosses</review>
      <review>better world design</review>
      <review>better puzzles</review>
      <review>better beam combat. The only issue I can think of is that some of the bosses' weakpoint isn't conveyed to the player clearly which could make a couple of bosses on a first playthrough frustrating and a real slog"</review>
      <review>"Echoes</review>
      <review>maybe fittingly for a game split between two worlds</review>
      <review>can be equally compelling and frustrating. It engages novel ideas for the franchise — inserting some survival horror mechanics into series that should be ripe for them — and taking on noticeable creative risks with its doubled worlds and augmented difficulty. But it wears out its welcome well before the end with an overlong fetch quest that fails to recapture the flow of the first game's artifact hunt</review>
      <review>and its world</review>
      <review>while atmospheric and gloomy</review>
      <review>only really has one aesthetically-arresting zone. Couple that with one of the worst final boss fights I've ever played and generally overburdened combat throughout</review>
      <review>and it's a hard game to recommend to anyone who isn't already deep into the series' marginalia."</review>
      <review>'Taking pretty much everything the original game did</review>
      <review>expanding</review>
      <review>and refining it</review>
      <review>Prime 2 is simply one of the best games in the entire Metroid franchise. The dichotomy of the Dark World allows the game to keep the backtracking elements Prime 1 was infamous for</review>
      <review>but implement them in a way that is significantly less obtrusive and unintuitive. And while it takes a bit to get there</review>
      <review>it has some beautiful art direction</review>
      <review>with Sanctuary Fortress standing out as incredibly striking and beautiful</review>
      <review>and I’m willing to bet it would look even better with an HD remaster like the first game got. Luckily</review>
      <review>this game also rectified of Prime 1’s unfortunate flaws</review>
      <review>a lack of an ending escape timer</review>
      <review>and it does it in a great and memorable way</review>
      <review>having you face off against Dark Samus in one of the coolest confrontations in the series while on the clock to the entire Dark Aether dimension being destroyed. Overall</review>
      <review>this is an undeniable classic that anyone who is interested in Metroid should get around to playing.'</review>
      <review>'1 step forward</review>
      <review>1.01 steps back. Ultimately Prime 2 is still an utterly fantastic game</review>
      <review>but it just doesn\'t reach the same highs as Prime 1.\n \n Like Prime</review>
      <review>Echoes\'s atmosphere is top-notch. Rather than aiming for a lonely atmosphere like Prime</review>
      <review>Echoes aims for a significantly more oppressive and terrifying feel</review>
      <review>and it absolutely succeeds. The Dark Aether areas are genuinely unsettling at times</review>
      <review>with their Silent Hill-esque music and body-horror visual design.\n \n It\'s hard to really elucidate what makes Echoes a little less great than Prime</review>
      <review>but I think it really comes down to the backtracking. I know "lmao Echoes backtracking" is a meme</review>
      <review>but it really does drag the game out longer than it needs to. In particular</review>
      <review>returning to the Temple Grounds after every main area and the Sky Temple key hunt during the endgame are the biggest culprits.\n \n The much higher level of difficulty is also a point of contention in the community</review>
      <review>but I always found Prime 1 to be a little too easy</review>
      <review>to Echoes\'s greater challenge is welcome in my eyes. The final boss in particular was an excellent challenge.\n \n Overall</review>
      <review>Echoes is still an excellent game despite not being quite as good as Prime 1</review>
      <review>and in my eyes is nonetheless a worthy sequel that adds almost as much as it subtracts from Prime 1.'</review>
      <review>"The coolest part about Metroid is being alone in a vast and hostile environment. In Dark Aether</review>
      <review>you're maybe the only being capable of speech in the whole universe and the air damages you. It doesn't get more alone or hostile than that."</review>

      <review>but when the game finally came out I never played past the first area somehow ... Finally decided to fully try this a few years later and wow\n \n So yeah</review>
      <review>visually it's gorgeous</review>
      <review>musically too. Gameplay is very interesting (I played with Mouse+keybord)</review>
      <review>reminds me a bit of NieR. There's a lot of plateforming/parkour despite the top-down angle</review>
      <review>and the areas are very fun to explore (although they tend to be a bit TOO large actually). Big dungeons with great puzzles and mechanics that can get quite hard. Great stuff really !\n \n The story ends up being really good too</review>
      <review>despite the SAO vibe haha. I think the game has interesting stuff to say about AI and virtual worlds. And I just love the characters</review>
      <review>I don't even really know why but they just feel very human</review>
      <review>in their interactions with each others.\n \n It's a very inspiring game for me. They were multipe times where I had to actually stop playing because I couldn't focus because I just kept thinking about how inspiring it was ..."</review>

      <review>but i sense that its difficulty makes it inaccessible to a lot of people."</review>

    <summary>CHRONO CROSS, the sequel to the SNES favorite CHRONO TRIGGER, is one of the most ambitious role-playing games ever made. There are over 40 playable characters, each with their back-story, special moves, abilities, and weapons. The story spans two discs and follows the story of Serge, a young man who is able to cross dimensions. Suddenly he is pulled between worlds, trying to figure out his own past at the same time. The graphics are bright and beautiful, utilizing the PlayStation's capabilities to the fullest. The polygonal character models are huge and detailed, and the pre-rendered backgrounds are immaculately detailed. The music is composed and arranged by Yasunori Mitsuda, and features very realistic-sounding synthesizers. The battle system revolves around Elements, which are used to grant magical powers, as well as to summon huge monsters. For anyone that wanted to see the story of CHRONO TRIGGER continue, this is your chance.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>['Chrono Cross foi um jogo que eu demorei um tempo pra decidir terminar ele</review>
      <review>desde criança até mais adulto</review>
      <review>sempre jogava chegava em um certo ponto do game e parava de jogar e então por N motivos acaba perdendo o save do jogo</review>
      <review>mas hoje finalmente pude terminar essa obra prima de jogo. Assim como seu antecessor Chrono Trigger</review>
      <review>este jogo é um maravilha. Em minha opinião este jogo acaba não sendo melhor que seu antecessor</review>
      <review>mas isso não faz dele um jogo ruim nem de longe.\n \n As mecânicas do jogo são bem diferentes de qualquer outro RPG</review>
      <review>tanto que se você pega esse jogo pra jogar logo após o anterior você acaba ficando perdido</review>
      <review>mas não se engane pois as mecânicas desse jogo são muito bem feitas</review>
      <review>uma única critica que tenho é pelo sistema de field que você pode passar um aperto se quiser usar os summons do game</review>
      <review>mas de resto</review>
      <review>é uma sistema totalmente funcional e bem feito.\n \n A trilha sonora do game é impecável</review>
      <review>assim como seu antecessor</review>
      <review>o jogo está repleto de musicas épicas e emocionantes.\n \n A historia do game pode ser um pouco confusa se comparar com Chrono Trigger mas acompanhar ela desde o inicio ao fim me emocionou quando eu finalmente consegui terminar. Alerta para quem tem facilidade em se emocionar</review>
      <review>talvez você chore com o final desse jogo.\n \n Pontos ruins desse jogo como eu já disse</review>
      <review>é o sistema de field que pode se tornar um pouco difícil de entender e conseguir completar a field inteira com uma cor só e também pelos chefes do jogo serem um pouco fáceis</review>
      <review>principalmente o ultimo chefe</review>
      <review>outro ponto negativo é que pelo fato de terem muitos personagens no jogo</review>
      <review>muitos deles acabam não sendo utilizados pois você se acostuma muito com uma equipe e não quer trocar por nada.\n \n Num geral eu dou a minha nota de 4/5 pra esse jogo</review>
      <review>recomendo a todos os fãs de J-RPG por ai jogarem e experimentarem essa aventura maluca envolvendo mundos alternativos.'</review>
      <review>'The combat is really terrible and the story breaks down really hard at the end</review>
      <review>but the aesthetic is unmatched. What a vibe</review>
      <review>what a head trip.'</review>
      <review>'An great idea</review>
      <review>however there are a few points that should be considered when talking about this game:'</review>
      <review>"A great game both in spite and because of its connections to the masterful Chrono Trigger. While it took me a little while to come to grips with the combat system</review>
      <review>I wound up liking it a lot once I did. The story's really existential and fascinating</review>
      <review>if clunky and convoluted. Absolutely excellent music and art direction</review>
      <review>with its bright colors saturating coral reefs and coastal towns. It may not be Chrono Trigger</review>
      <review>but it makes a statement all its own"</review>
      <review>"I'm more of a Chrono Trigger guy myself</review>
      <review>but I've tried to enjoy this game. I attempted to sit down and play this game 3 separate times throughout the years... but each attempt always ends with me putting the game down. There's just something about the battle system and the main battle theme that puts me off. The rest of its soundtrack is absolutely incredible though!"</review>

It is the ninth main installment in the Fire Emblem series,[c] and the third to be released in the west. As with previous installments, gameplay revolves around positioning characters on a battlefield to defeat an opposing force. If characters are defeated in battle, they are removed from the rest of the game.</summary>

      <review>'The year was 2014</review>
      <review>back when Donkey Kong Country was still a household name. My first time experiencing Fire Emblem was through my sister recommending me to check out Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</review>
      <review>citing it as a creation made by the team behind Super Paper Mario</review>
      <review>which we loved dearly. Using the power of emulation</review>
      <review>I got it completely playable on Dolphin</review>
      <review>where she took the helm and played it the whole way through. And surely</review>
      <review>Intelligent Systems was indeed responsible for making one of the most riveting tales told on the GCN</review>
      <review>2nd behind Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. A lot of people see this as the quintessential Fire Emblem game</review>
      <review>as well as the peak. It gets close</review>
      <review>but I think the reason why people deem that is because of its heightened fantasy elements. Instead of having only Manaketes as supposed “sub-humans” which is a funny play on racism</review>
      <review>the Manaketes were renamed to Dragon Laguz</review>
      <review>because that’s what they are</review>
      <review>essentially. Laguz are humanoid creatures that can turn into either Lynxes</review>
      <review>Saber Toothed Tigers</review>
      <review>Lions</review>
      <review>Crows</review>
      <review>Hawks</review>
      <review>White Herons</review>
      <review>and of course</review>
      <review>Dragons. Despite there being 3 Laguz nations</review>
      <review>I actually listed every Laguz species I could think of</review>
      <review>which shows how memorable this game is. Now compare that to Berwick Saga</review>
      <review>released the exact same year. Berwick Saga has only Dragons</review>
      <review>where they are nearly extinct and could’ve been written out of Berwick Saga entirely</review>
      <review>considering they were used to explain the past of Berwick’s world</review>
      <review>which is far cooler</review>
      <review>in my opinion. Not that the added fantasy elements to FE9 are bad</review>
      <review>it just feels a little off to me</review>
      <review>considering your opponent in FE9 is still a human “Beorc” nation with a refined Imperial Army</review>
      <review>with Izuka experimenting on how to use the Laguz to Daein’s advantage</review>
      <review>a concept which came to fruition in FE10 and was one of the many good things that game pulled off despite the overambition. I remember my sister and I watching this cutscene from FE9 in 2014</review>
      <review>where my father literally asked me how the heck this great red lion turned into a man</review>
      <review>and I couldn’t help but think about how silly this 2005 CG cutscene looked when I first saw it.'</review>
      <review>"another fun enough map-clicking</review>
      <review>mice-moving experience</review>
      <review>but doesn't inspire much the level of thought I'd like out of my rpg brain</review>
      <review>and that really bothers me!"]</review>

    <summary>Originally released only in Japan on December 26, 2002, Kingdom Hearts Final Mix has several events and a number of gameplay tweaks that are not in previous releases. Spoken dialogue is in English, with Japanese subtitles. New scenes, clarifying certain plot points, such as Riku's journey and foreshadowing of Kingdom Hearts II, were included, but no new dialogue was recorded. A gameplay option allows the player to skip cutscenes after seeing them once. The optional bosses first included in the English version were introduced to Japanese players for the first time, along with a new fight against "Unknown Man," in an attempt to raise interest for the sequel.</summary>

    <summary>In the curious village of St. Mystere, townsfolk speak to each other in riddles, lock their doors with sliding puzzles and hide their secrets within brainteasers. When a wealthy baron passes away, his will reveals an elusive treasure hidden someplace inside the village. Now it's up to Professor Layton to untangle St. Mystere's riddles and puzzles, find the hidden treasure, and crack the case.</summary>

      <review>["It's a very charming game even if there's a bit much in the puzzle department. Lots of math and space puzzles ranging in difficulty from braindeadly easy to getting bludgeoned over the head with a hammer to both at the same time. It certainly is cool to think outside the metaphorical box but it did also kinda make me paranoid about whether or not the puzzle instructions weren't another trick question or not. The story was fun even if it makes less sense the more you think about it. There was heart put into it and I can appreciate that. There was also a surprising amount of animated cutscenes</review>
      <review>that really took me by surprise as well. Overall game is aight</review>
      <review>but my head hurts now"</review>
      <review>'This is fun to pick up and play now and then especially on mobile</review>
      <review>but it is quite limited gameplay wise and has way too many annoying (aka not clever) puzzles to be engaging for longer than 20 minutes at a time.'</review>
      <review>'Lots of fun brain teasers mixed together with a charming little story. They don\'t do an amazing job with fitting the puzzles into the story (not that I\'d expect them to) but they do have a few moments where it either ties in to what\'s happening</review>
      <review>or a character has a personality based around puzzle types that can be pretty fun. There is a heavy reuse of puzzle types the further you get though. Even most of the bonus puzzles you can unlock are just the same ones you\'ve done before but on "hard mode".'</review>
      <review>'a great introduction to the series</review>
      <review>with an amazing artstyle</review>
      <review>music</review>
      <review>and some cool misteries</review>
      <review>though i wish they gave you the chance to solve them yourself instead of being exposed to the solution at the end (which is weird considering the entire premise of the game is to solve puzzles).'</review>
      <review>'Although not all puzzles are equally gret throughout the whole game</review>
      <review>they alone would be enough to hold up an entire game even without the charming story and atmosphere'</review>
      <review>'Taken me a while to get around to playing and glad I’ve finally taken my first step in this series. Story is somewhat limited but the puzzles are of a good enough variety to keep me engaged. Can’t wait to see how the rest of the series grows.']</review>

    <reviews>
      <review>["Ys VIII ties a very fun to explore island with a surprisingly gripping story that goes a bit off the rails towards the end. Combat is fast an fluid but suffers from having the player controlled camera with a subpar lock on system as opposed to fixed camera angles like previous games. The game does a very good job at tying your game progression to the story as finding all the castaways fits perfectly with the exploration. The castaways aren't just for the story as they can grant you access to items or other services as well as the ability to eliminate roadblocks in the world. The bonus dungeon you play during certain sections of the game is easily the best in the game and incorporates puzzles in a way that I wish were present in other parts of the game."</review>

    <summary>Try to live a week as The Postal Dude doing everyday chores on your to-do list, such as picking up milk at the grocery store. In a world where cats can be used as assault rifle silencers, it's not surprising that a milk carton costs 5 bucks. Stealing said carton might be relatively easy in your basic corner shop, but when the shop is owned by a bunch of trigger happy jihadists, you might want to think twice about trying to leave without paying for your overpriced groceries. Little mistakes like that might just flip the switch and make you go postal.</summary>

    <summary>Marvel's Midnight Suns is a new tactical RPG set in the darker side of the Marvel Universe, putting you face-to-face against demonic forces of the underworld as you team up with and live among the Midnight Suns, Earth's last line of defense.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>['Average Marvel writing aside</review>
      <review>this game was surprisingly good</review>
      <review>deep enough tactically to keep the intrigue throughout combat encounters with a pretty solid story and a great cast of characters with interactions similar to the Mass Effect games. The writing is pretty poo poo though.'</review>
      <review>"The core gameplay of this game is so strong that I'm giving it 5 stars</review>
      <review>even though there are obvious areas for improvement. Going into this</review>
      <review>I had heard that the card combat was solid</review>
      <review>but that 2/3 of the game was Persona style conversations with your teammates. Superficially</review>
      <review>that's true. However</review>
      <review>the loop of:"</review>
      <review>"i'm playing as Lord Farquad/Bruno Bucciarati and it's great"</review>
      <review>'What was kind of a slow start started turning into an amazing game. The dialogue originally put me off</review>
      <review>but I eventually got used to it. Sometimes you just want a game with 70% of it being hanging with your bros (who happen to be super heroes) and 30% of it being a deep card battle tactics game.'</review>
      <review>'I\'m surprised</review>
      <review>to a degree difficult to be concise upon. I actually tried to cheese the Steam refund policy with this game; playing the game exclusively offline for the first two weeks</review>
      <review>very much expecting it to be so bad I\'d need to refund it... and now here I stand quite frustrated that my achievements from those initial unrecorded 10+ hours of gameplay are missing. It is not without fault mind you</review>
      <review>buggy textures</review>
      <review>wobbly writing</review>
      <review>they somehow made Blade more annoying than Captain Marvel</review>
      <review>weirdness like that. However</review>
      <review>the gameplay is really sublime. I originally felt the card format would be a hinderance towards what I was seeing as the main innovation</review>
      <review>the lack of tile movement</review>
      <review>but have been proven quite wrong. The game so excellently subdues its RNG to a degree quite unlike the former X-COM devs I know and despise</review>
      <review>the game plays like a card game of sorts</review>
      <review>with the explosive always just off of OTKs you achieve and the deckbuilding I always appreciate. The difficulty scaling is for the most part</review>
      <review>rather fantastic</review>
      <review>with my current playthrough having just recently reached max difficulty. It\'s hard to go so in-depth without this all devolving into a bunch of disjointed points so I\'ll try to give my overall opinion: "It\'s a pretty good game that is so distinctly of this era. (writing/game design trends) However</review>
      <review>where it trend chases</review>
      <review>it feels weak</review>
      <review>and I feel that it if it focused on the core of the game</review>
      <review>it would be significantly better. However on that however</review>
      <review>a part of me feels an over-tuned version of what I like in the game</review>
      <review>could very likely make another X-COM2. (A game I\'m not fond of</review>
      <review>but maybe that could have been a good thing for those who do)'</review>
      <review>'El estilo de combate por turnos combinado con cartas y movimiento y uso del entorno es super entretenido. Esto sumado a las habilidades de cada personaje y a la cantidad de estos hace que el combate sea super disfrutable. Luego también tenemos la zona de la Abadía donde nos podremos mover libremente</review>
      <review>explorar</review>
      <review>conseguir recursos y conocer mejor a nuestros compañeros</review>
      <review>lo cual a mi</review>
      <review>fan de la saga Persona me flipa. Todo esto añadido al mundo de Marvel consiguen que sea un juego casi perfecto.']</review>

Using specials at the cost of health never made much sense to me in retro beat em ups but with this game allowing you to regain your lost health with follow up attacks not only adds some extra risk v reward in the combat but also encourages me to use specials WAY goddamn more.

    <summary>Persona is a philosophical game that takes place in a world close to our own. It is a departure from the typical swords and sorcery, and it delivers a tale of dreams, the purpose of life, and who we are as individuals. In Persona you have modern weapons like an Uzi and an AK-47. And instead of always fighting monsters, you are given the opportunity to talk your way through a confrontation. By talking things out, you can earn components of spells the more components you have, the more powerful your spells become.</summary>

    <summary>Kirby and his friends are back in an adventure designed to satisfy longtime Kirby fans and beginners alike. When an alien spaceship crashes in the otherwise peaceful realm of Pop Star, its pieces are scattered throughout the land. Players must guide Kirby as he retrieves the ship’s parts and helps the aliens return to their home planet. This time, however, he’s not alone. At any time, up to three more players can join in the fun and play as Meta Knight, King Dedede and Waddle Dee to help Kirby in his quest.</summary>

    <summary>The game is set in Ancient Greece and loosely based on its mythology. The player controls Kratos, a Spartan warrior in the service of the Olympian Gods. Kratos is guided by the goddess Athena, who instructs him to find the Sun God Helios, as the Dream God Morpheus has caused the remaining gods to slumber in Helios' absence. With the power of the sun, Morpheus and Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld, with the aid of the Titan Atlas, intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn Olympus. God of War: Chains of Olympus is chronologically the second chapter in the series, which focuses on vengeance as its central theme.</summary>

      <review>Nice story</review>
      <review>cool mechanics and... It s GOW</review>

      <review>'Better than\n \n\n GoW I\n \n\n and\n \n\n GoW II\n \n\n</review>
      <review>if only because the combat here feels more like there\'s some actual strategy involved (though the evade roll is still junk) and it manages its length a whole lot better - this version of Kratos feels better in bite-sized spurts</review>
      <review>the repetition issue previous games had isn\'t really felt so much in this one. The weapons + magic are fun to use</review>
      <review>it pushes the PSP to its limits (though of course the dependably pretty HD remaster is the way to play)</review>
      <review>and even though the environments aren\'t as dashing as the second game there\'s still some more winners to add to the series\' roster of solid levels here - particularly the giant temple of Helios</review>
      <review>and the titan Hyperion melded into the cliff face. Still not convinced there\'s too much going on in these that you can\'t find elsewhere</review>
      <review>but we\'re starting to get there. Not too shabby</review>
      <review>even the "Challenge of Hades" is half tolerable!'</review>
      <review>'Ru Weerasuriya you absolute madman</review>
      <review>you not only tried and succeeded in making a 3D God of war game for the PSP</review>
      <review>But you somehow also managed to make it a great game with amazing gameplay and a great story.'</review>
      <review>'Se tem uma coisa que eu tinha esquecido era o quanto eu gostava de God of War. Eu acho que não jogava algum jogo desde quando zerei o II no PS2 na época e como fui pro 360 seguia até hoje sem jogar algum jogo "novo" da franquia</review>
      <review>querendo ou não. Infelizmente nunca tive um PSP</review>
      <review>e meu PC não tanka o jogo no emulador</review>
      <review>por sorte peguei um celular novo que rodou o emulador liso e a primeira coisa que pensei foi em jogar os GOWs de PSP que sempre foram uma pendência minha. Da pra ver que é uma experiência GOW de PS2 bem nerfada mas cara... como fazia anos que eu não tinha essa "experiência GOW de PS2" eu gostei bastante</review>

    <summary>Splatoon is primarily a team-based third-person shooter which is playable by up to eight players in 4-vs-4 matches, although the game also features a single-player campaign. Players control characters called Inklings, wich can change between human form and squid form. Transforming into a squid allows players to swim through ink of their own color, even up walls and through grates, hiding from the enemy and replenishing their ink supply in the process.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>['to me</review>
      <review>the single-player story was kinda dry for a game about ink</review>
      <review>but the conversations in-between characters was really funny and the multiplayer was what i mainly played anyway. the levels were admittedly pretty creative and i liked finding all the secrets</review>
      <review>i just wish the story wasn\'t just "yo</review>
      <review>this fish was stolen</review>
      <review>go get it back".'</review>
      <review>'The servers sucked'</review>
      <review>"Full of creativity and colorful fun. One of the best things to come out of the wii U era for sure. This game is unbalanced as shit and that's kinda why I love it. Also has some of my favorite maps in the series and a lot of fun gamemodes. The maps rotating every 4 hours was kinda lame though. Splatfests were also vibes</review>
      <review>but alas they are long gone. I got to S rank once</review>
      <review>absolute struggle. Fun as all hell</review>
      <review>honestly still the best in the series after two sequels that just kinda did the same thing over and over."</review>
      <review>'This odd game was a heavy hitter in the multiplayer space</review>
      <review>even if it suffered from some Nintendo Jank.'</review>
      <review>'i really loved being a squid and a kid for the first time ever'</review>
      <review>"The best and most unique TPS game</review>
      <review>only made better by it's controls and fantastic gameplay. Splatoon is one of those games you will either love it</review>
      <review>hate it</review>
      <review>or not care about it at all. But this game has such a perfect aesthetic charm to it. The single player leaves a bit to be desires but that isn't why you play the game</review>
      <review>it's more so a fun warmup mode to get mastery on the weapons you're interested in. The multiplayer is really where this game shines</review>
      <review>it's chaotic and unbalanced but honestly it's a Nintendo game so it's ok. One amazing point of the game though is it's Splatfests which at the time were fantastic ways to get involved in the Splatoon community through posting art on Miiverse and getting hyped up for your side. When this game had it's final Splatfest it was genuinely an emotional moment playing till the Splatfest ended (Team Callie BTW). The ranked experience was fun</review>
      <review>but it really I really wish you could have played the ranked games without playing ranked for casual play with friends</review>
      <review>I got up to S+ and stuck to playing the Splatfests. Overall for a new Nintendo IP on the Wii U of all consoles</review>
      <review>it was hit out of the ball park for how good this game was."]</review>

    <summary>Sonic the Hedgehog has a new partner, Blaze the Cat, in this fast-paced platformer, Sonic Rush. You can play as either Sonic or Blaze as you try to track down powerful Sol emeralds. Sonic Rush displays the level over both screens, allowing for screen-spanning jumps and dives. Some gameplay modes include stylus support as well. Designed as a 2.5D side-scroller, Sonic Rush is the first game in the Sonic series to explore both 2D and 3D venues by combining two-dimensional environments with three-dimensional models. In 2007, the game received a sequel, Sonic Rush Adventure.</summary>

      <review>e curto cerca de 4-5 horas pra finalizar. A historia achei muito nada haver com nada</review>
      <review>sem o menor sentido</review>
      <review>fora de não ter diálogo nenhum o jogo inteiro</review>
      <review>e pura interpretação</review>
      <review>mas ainda assim não me agradou. Roda mal no Xbox One</review>
      <review>em algumas partes a ponto de engasgar</review>
      <review>um jogo desses deveria estar a 60 FPS sem cair</review>
      <review>enfim jogo indie porém bem mequetrefe na minha opinião.'</review>
      <review>'Da cierta rabia jugar a Somerville porque</review>
      <review>ciertamente</review>
      <review>lo intenta. Intenta contar algo interesante</review>
      <review>aunque no fresco</review>
      <review>y parece tratar de poner el foco en les jugadores invitando a una reflexión</review>
      <review>una de tantas</review>
      <review>como lo que hizo Inside de una forma muy rotunda e infinitamente más acertada.'</review>
      <review>'Sense of direction was iffy</review>
      <review>but fun game. Loved the puzzles and actiony parts'</review>
      <review>'Se habla mucho de Inside y Limbo por el origen de uno de los creadores de Somerville</review>
      <review>y bastante de Inside hay (no de Limbo). Sin embargo</review>
      <review>para entender del todo la experiencia que ofrece sería necesario mencionar Another World. Aunque aquí no se llega a empuñar ni una pistola (ni un escudo)</review>
      <review>y las mecánicas asociadas a los poderes del personaje se utilizan básicamente para resolver puzzles</review>
      <review>detrás hay un intento de contar la interacción entre una inteligencia humana y una alienígena sin utilizar la palabra. Todo se sostiene sobre la imagen y esas mecánicas de las que hablo. Una propuesta valiente por hacer algo menos masticadito de lo que suele ser habitual. La pena es que la historia funciona mejor como sucesión de secuencias que como un todo bien atado</review>
      <review>algo que también afecta al desarrollo de la acción. Y cuesta encontrarle el sentido a las acciones que acomete el personaje. Con esto en mente</review>
      <review>Somerville queda como una experiencia irregular</review>
      <review>con algunos diseños chulos</review>
      <review>buena música</review>
      <review>tres o cuatro puzzles muy bien pensados</review>
      <review>y la sensación de que hubiera necesitado más tiempo/dinero para alcanzar lo que sobre el papel parecía una buena idea.']</review>

Pushed to the edges of the galaxy by the Empire, Cal will find himself surrounded by threats new and familiar.

      <review>Alice Madness Returns mostra o clássico conto de Alice no País das Maravilhas em\n \n uma versão mais densa e sombria. Com uma mecânica simples de Platformer 3D e uma ambientação linda em um estilo\n \n Gothic Fantasy</review>
      <review>o jogo conta com uma narrativa densa em uma releitura do conto original. Alice Madness Returns é\n \n dividido em capítulos</review>
      <review>e cada um de seus capítulos conta com uma ambientação e temática únicas. Os cenários</review>
      <review>inimigos\n \n e até mesmo as roupas da protagonista mudam conforme a ambientação. Sua estética lembra bastante com a dos\n \n filmes de Tim Burton (Que havia adaptado um filme de Alice no País das Maravilhas um ano antes do lançamento de\n \n Madness Returns). Em geral</review>

      <review>Alice Madness Returns possui um dos melhores visuais de toda a sétima geração de consoles.\n \n Mesmo com os avanços tecnológicos</review>
      <review>o jogo mantém um frescor que sabe se misturar bem com a essência dos jogos da época\n \n Para muitos esse jogo pode ser batido e repetitivo</review>

      <review>Alice Madness Returns continua sendo um dos melhores jogos do Xbox 360.'</review>

      <review>'Pretty fun game. I personally always found the twists on classical fairy tales interesting</review>
      <review>and the combat in this game is really good too. My only gripe with this game is that it becomes slow paced and repetitive after a few hours</review>
      <review>which might lose your interest.'</review>
      <review>'One of the best art directions in gaming history IMO.\n \n VERY memorable music too.']</review>

      <review>'3 Mario games ranging from just good too a literal masterpiece. The collection is lazy though and offers nothing in terms of bonus content. The conversion to a controller for Galaxy works well and is completely playable. The Shindou version of 64 is a damn shame since it makes the game a whole lot more fun and results in lowering the skill cap. Sunshine had problems on release but is fixed now I believe. Good games but a lackluster collection.'</review>

    <summary>Year 2012. Six years passed since the time of the Second catastrophe to have made the April events of 1986 fade. The game is set in the Chernobyl exclusion zone which turned from a destiny-breaker place into a threat to all mankind. The Zone is reluctant to open up its mysteries and needs to be forced to do it. It is a rare hero who can reach the very heart of the Zone onto find out what danger awaits him there. A danger which, compared to marauders and enemy groupings, all monsters and anomalies, will seem a mere preparation to the meeting with something more fatal and threatening. But for now… get ready, hero. Collect artefacts and trade, grope your path and keep an eye on the rear, catch roentgens and fight – only make sure you survive! And then, perhaps, if you are persistent and truly lucky, you will find out why all this had fallen on you.</summary>

      <review>so the online is pretty bad but besides that</review>
      <review>everything else here is nice. Besides the lack of Part 8 (JoJolion) content... There's one JoJolion character in the game (Josuke) and his moveset is the same as it was in the original All-Star Battle that released 2 years into its serialization</review>
      <review>there's been 8 extra years of JoJolion since then but no update to Josuke and no new characters. Unfortunate..."</review>

      <review>'A very solid game! I thought the first Mario + Rabbids game was surprisingly good</review>
      <review>but I think this is a really solid improvement. A wider roster</review>
      <review>varied locations</review>
      <review>and a somewhat revamped combat system are all great!'</review>
      <review>'Normally not a huge fan of this genre but the Mario brand combined with Grant Kirkhope’s score and its writing is enough to keep me on the board for the most part. Though it becomes stale towards the end</review>
      <review>especially trying to get 100%. I was fully committed to going for 100% when I started but after getting everything in two words I just go so burnt out lol. Becomes incredibly tedious and dull. This is definitely a game/genre enjoyed in small sittings (for me at least) and I didn’t really do that. Already purchased the DLC so will be checking those out when they release. Honestly like that they’re spacing out their launches so I’ll have reasons to come back to this a couple times.'</review>

    <summary>Resident Evil is a survival horror classic in which a group of special forces agents, known as S.T.A.R.S, struggle against hordes of zombies and various other mutants in a mysterious mansion as they try to uncover the truth behind the terrifying infection. The gameplay environment consists of polygonal 3D characters placed over pre-rendered 2D backgrounds. As such, the game relies on pre-determined camera angles for a view of the action instead of a real-time camera like most games. The game is credited for coining the phrase "survival horror" and popularizing the genre.</summary>

      <review>["(Played before 2023)\n \n This game did not age well. It is a product of its time and a lot of bad parts about it are seen as charming like the voice acting</review>
      <review>but the voice acting is still</review>
      <review>well</review>
      <review>bad. Like a cheesey horror film</review>
      <review>the story is dumb and stupid</review>
      <review>and there is a lot of goofy moments (You were almost a Jill sandwich!). The design of the game is really good though</review>
      <review>dealing with zombies in terms of trying to avoid them and risk getting bit</review>
      <review>or clearing the threat with ammo and hoping you don't need it later. But overall there isn't anything special going on with it outside of the historical importance</review>
      <review>so if you're not a fan of the series</review>
      <review>especially the remake</review>
      <review>just don't play it."</review>
      <review>"REmake 4 prep still. gonna be cutting it really close with trying to fit all of this shit in but i'm determined."</review>
      <review>'Resident Evil 1 is certainly a product of its time. It controls like molasses and its tank controls don’t help much. Since I played the original version</review>
      <review>I did not have access to the auto-aim system that’s found in the Director’s Cut and Dualshock versions which made enemy encounters a lot more difficult than they needed to be. You could argue that this does enhance the horror aspects of this game</review>
      <review>making you feel powerless against these monsters</review>
      <review>however</review>
      <review>it felt less like an intentional choice and more of a fault with the gameplay. Puzzles aren’t as tricky or archaic as I thought they were going to be. Every puzzle is fairly obvious and there are plenty of clues barring a few instances but for a PS1 puzzle game</review>
      <review>that is an accomplishment. The story is total non-sense thanks to the terrible voice-acting but despite this</review>
      <review>I could still get invested in these characters. There’s enough intrigue where I felt interested in this game’s plot despite of its flaws that I’m actually excited to play its sequels. If you’re going to play RE1 for the PlayStation</review>
      <review>just play the later editions as they fix many flaws found with this version.'</review>
      <review>'Um clássico do survival horror</review>
      <review>pai do gênero</review>
      <review>em geral é a mesma opinião minha sobre o remake</review>
      <review>tirando o fato de ser bem mais duro</review>
      <review>e datado</review>
      <review>principalmente sua dublagem</review>
      <review>mas tudo isso é um certo charme. Grande parte do valor do jogo está no seu valor histórico</review>
      <review>e sua importância pro gênero e pra época</review>
      <review>apesar de não ter muitos motivos pra escolher esse sobre o remake</review>
      <review>já que o remake de fato substitui o original</review>
      <review>o clássico tem um peso enorme pra mim</review>
      <review>fez parte da minha infância</review>
      <review>e ele tem um certo encanto</review>
      <review>em seus gráficos antigos e sua trilha sonora'</review>
      <review>"Not as great as the remake because it hasn't aged super great and is lacking the undeniable amazing additions</review>
      <review>but it's still aged much better than most people say. I have many things to say about it but the remake just improves on every aspect of it</review>
      <review>so there's no point in writing about it. Undoubtedly one of the most genre defining games of all time</review>
      <review>and was far ahead of it's time to the point that the hardware was really holding them back from their vision."</review>

    <summary>Oxenfree is a supernatural adventure game. Rites of passage and Senior year traditions set the stage for a group of friends sneaking off to Edwards Island, an old military outpost with no phone service. Players will take on the role of Alex as she brings her new stepbrother Jonas to an overnight party gone horribly wrong. Inspired by classic cult films like Stand by Me and Poltergeist, Oxenfree is an adventure that pulls from the past but looks to the present. “It’s a coming of age story where players control how their hero comes of age,” says Sean Krankel, co-founder of Night School. “We’re drawing on the fond and mortifying aspects of being in your late teens, and setting it against a dangerous and ghostly backdrop.”</summary>

    <summary>Sly Cooper is the latest in a long line of master thieves. When he was a kit, a gang called the Fiendish Five killed his family and divided up their book on the art of thieving: the Thievius Raccoonus. Sly must defeat all the members of the gang to recover the book while evading Carmelita Fox, a police officer chasing him around the world to apprehend him. This game is divided into five worlds, each themed around a particular part of the world and the villain headquartered there. Most worlds are structured as a central hub with entrances to numerous individual levels. Each of the levels has a primary goals which earns you a key. You must collect all the keys in the world to fight the world's boss. Many of the levels have a platformer structure. The objective of these worlds is to reach the location of the key. There are substantial stealth elements here as you must dodge searchlights and trips lasers which set off alarms and avoid alerting guards. In addition to the main objective, there are clue bottles to find. Finding all the clues in a level allows you to open a safe with a page from the Thievius Raccoonus which grants a new ability of some sort. After getting this, there is also a master thief sprint where you must get from the start of a level to the exit within a time limit.</summary>

      <review>&amp; floaty controls in game with many moments requiring precise input."</review>
      <review>"This is the most rage-inducing children's game I have ever fucking played. It's a fun game with some pretty cool levels but god damn some of the shit in here is fucking god awful.

      <review>that fucking crab level</review>
      <review>the fucking chicken level</review>
      <review>the fucking races</review>
      <review>not to mention that fucking button memorization boss fight. The fucking buttons I pressed didn't register so I ended up failing and having to restart from the very beginning no matter how far I got. That's another thing</review>
      <review>the lack of checkpoints in very critical parts of a level. When you have boss fights with multiple phases in a kids game</review>
      <review>MAKE A FUCKING CHECKPOINT AFTER EVERY PHASE. You just spent 10 minutes trying to parkour over this lava and you died? FUCK OFF AND DO IT AGAIN!"</review>
      <review>"(Played before 2023)\n \n Ehhh</review>
      <review>I liked this game but not really that much. Sly is a really cool character and I like the art style and some of the gameplay design</review>
      <review>but I hate the SM64 style design of levels. Dying in one hit feels weird in this game and I can't explain why</review>
      <review>but I was really craving a health bar halfway through. I also wish there were more modern urban environments like Paris or the casino level</review>
      <review>but sadly that wasn't the case. It still was good though and I think it is a decent enough game</review>
      <review>just not one I want to experience again."</review>

      <review>liked the vibe</review>
      <review>liked the stealth gameplay</review>
      <review>just overall a fun time. The one-hit deaths were kinda annoying though but it do be a stealth-oriented platformer so avoiding combat is really your best bet. I've been meaning to play the rest of the series for the longest time but just haven't gotten around to it..."</review>

      <review>as it was a generic save-the-world type of thing. It also occasionally felt like the difficulty curve wasn't very well tuned. It went from hard at the beginning of the game</review>
      <review>to easy for most of the mid-late game</review>
      <review>and then very difficult in the final dungeons where it suddenly required mastery of the tools at your disposal. I didn't mind that necessarily</review>

      <review>"With Chrono Trigger being one of the best RPGs of all time</review>
      <review>it's something that's hard to make a follow up with. Chrono Cross</review>
      <review>I believe</review>
      <review>is a wonderful follow up. It's not as solid of a game however: it's battle system is fun</review>
      <review>but it doesn't make the most out of itself. It's not as quick of a game â€” even if I wasn't playing the game with the fast forward button on</review>
      <review>the version I was playing had massive frame rate issues. It's story can become fairly convoluted and not as self contained as Trigger's story is</review>
      <review>either. But I think it does enough to continue the series within an interesting light and asks questions within the series that weren't ever really asked in Trigger."</review>
      <review>'Chrono cross is a lovely game. Like never have I wanted more to be sucked into the world of a video game than this one. It is so gorgeous looking! The backgrounds that feel like they could go on and on are so captivating. I love the coastal setting as well! That was such a thing at the turn of the millennium that Iâ€™ve always loved. I have such a soft spot for the beach and the ocean. How do you follow up a game as legendary as chrono trigger? Well</review>
      <review>in a lot of ways you try going out of your way to be the opposite of that game. This game is really innovative in the fact that instead of exploring time vertical you explore it horizontally with the many worlds approach. The music is fantastic like some of the best the graphics are gorgeous. Iâ€™m sure this game does look better on a PS1 with a crt</review>
      <review>but this is just a bit more convenient. I think it sucks how they used ai upscaling for this and itâ€™s a pretty lazy port. The battles system is super unique as well. I really respect that about it. It is kind of hard for me to get through with grinding not being much of a thing and healing feeling like a bit of a scarce commodity.']</review>

Observe what makes your civilization fall into eventual decline, and learn for next time… until something else inevitably goes wrong. The combat model includes skills, body parts, material properties, aimed attacks, wrestling, pain, nausea, various poison effects, and much more. It’s difficult to convey the depth of the generation. Hundreds of animals and monsters, many of which are randomly created for each world, as well as generated poetry, musical forms, instruments, and dances for your dwarves to practice and perform. A dynamic weather model tracks wind, humidity, and air masses to create fronts, clouds, storms, and blizzards. Over two hundred rock and mineral types can appear, in their proper geological environments.</summary>

    <summary>Pokémon Blue is the third core series Pokémon game released as a minor revision of Pokémon Red and Green, which were released earlier that year. It was thus the first solitary version in the core series of Pokémon games. Various fixes in the game include a graphics and sound upgrade, as well as the removal of several known glitches that had been found in the original pair. Outside of Japan, its graphics, game engine and script formed the basis of Pokémon Red and Blue, while the wild Pokémon and game-exclusive Pokémon lists were changed to match Red and Green.</summary>

      <review>upon actually playing it</review>
      <review>the core gameplay was a really lukewarm 2D platformer with not a lot of interesting theming going on with its levels to keep me engaged. The level design was good but the aesthetics had real "level editor" vibes to it</review>
      <review>i guess. The one thing holding the game together are the infinitely entertaining cutscenes between worlds</review>
      <review>they killed it with those. But I think this game is partly due to blame for why I didn\'t really bother even trying the Behemoth\'s latest projects. Castle crashers and alien hominid were both really good examples of the beat em up and run n gun genres</review>

The big puzzle rooms very intentionally exist to be be video game puzzle rooms but the context of a museum makes them kind of believable. Then you get some of the larger art pieces that spruce up the hallways between the bigger rooms and they are genuinely fun to just stand and stare at. The characters and their interactions are really enjoyable. I think Mary is a sweet heart and I for one forgive her for her crimes against humanity.'</review>

    <summary>Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is the first of the series to be based on the action/RPG structure of Castlevania:Symphony of the Night rather than the level-based action style of all previous Castlevania games. Dracula's castle is a single continuous building, and as Nathan discovers artifacts within it he gains new abilities that allow him to explore more of it. While Nathan can only use his Killer Whip as a weapon, he can find and equip different kinds of armor and accessories that change his stats. Unique to this entry in the series is the Dual Set-up System, where a combination of two cards will give Nathan unique magical abilities. For example, equipping a fire type card with a whip card will give the Killer Whip a fire attribute, while equipping it with a summon card will let Nathan summon a fire demon to attack onscreen enemies.</summary>

      <review>'Some of yall just haters this shit ain\'t even that bad\n \n "THE FINAL BOSS IS HARD NYUK NYUK NYUK"\n \n pro tip: take advantage of the gimmick of the game</review>
      <review>there is literally a card set that makes the final boss a cake walk. yall tripping.'</review>
      <review>"i was gonna be a little more generous with this game but after attempting the final boss and fucking up through all the tedium of trying to hit a floating eyeball probably at least 50 successive times without getting hit more than 4 times i just gave up. having played sotn before this game this one is just a significant step down. weird map design in certain areas</review>
      <review>a lot bosses that have one bullshit random attack that you most likely will not be able to dodge and will end up killing you hundreds of times until you're lucky enough to win. the game at least felt pretty good to play and had some good music</review>
      <review>and the card system is fun in concept</review>
      <review>but by the time i got to the end of the game i dont think i even managed to pick up half the cards and there's no way in hell im grinding for them. i guess i was also underleveled at the end of the game but again there's no way in hell i will grind in a game like this"</review>
      <review>"A fun continuation of what Symphony of the Night did</review>
      <review>but a little bit more scaled down to be on a portable. Exploring Dracula's castle is as fun as always</review>
      <review>the music kicks ass</review>
      <review>and the powerups you find for defeating bosses are always fun to use. However</review>
      <review>I didn't really like the way items were handled in this game. Drop rates are incredibly low</review>
      <review>and there is no shop so duplicate pieces of equipment become pointless. There are also these cards that you can combine to give yourself various effects</review>
      <review>and those cards are also locked behind random enemy drops. I would have liked it more if the cards were something you naturally found around the map rather than something that you have to grind for. The last bit of the game becomes a bit of a slog</review>
      <review>with the second to last boss being in a particularly annoying to reach area and the final boss being really cheaply designed imo. Despite that</review>
      <review>I still had a lot of fun with a majority of the time in this game</review>
      <review>so it's def worth trying if you like metroidvanias."</review>
      <review>'more like Circling back to the Entrance of the Room because you found another hallway that just leads to a dead end and a potion'</review>
      <review>"The map design in this one is actually fuckin tight. Too bad you'll spend the entire game double tapping the controller to dash at the weirdest fucking speed. The jump feels like homie is on the moon it's so wack. The soul system or whatever is cool in theory but it's so so so ass backwards. Story blows. Really not a fan of this one"]</review>

    <summary>Higurashi: When They Cry is a Japanese murder mystery visual novel. The series is focused on a group of young friends and the strange events that occur in the rural village of Hinamizawa, where they reside. The gameplay requires relatively little player interaction as most of the game is composed of text dialogues. The original release contained no voice acting for the characters. The game utilizes intermissions where the player can obtain several Tips. These Tips allow the player to read various supplementary information that may or may not be useful in solving the mystery.</summary>

The only problem I see with the game is the lack of a map system can make it frustrating to nevigate. But there's a reason why this game has a dozen fan remakes. It's a pretty stellar Metroid game. Definitely worth the little time it takes on NSO."</review>
      <review>"I didn't play this game back in the Game Boy days and it is pretty rough to play today on the Switch's emulator. It's no wonder we've gotten both a great official and unofficial remake for it. I shouldn't be too hard on it though. It was doing some cool stuff for the Game Boy. It feels pretty atmospheric with some interesting music and you do feel like you're descending into this scary alien planet. Unfortunately</review>
      <review>the lack of map and all the environments looking very similar (especially when it never got a colour version for the GBC) make it incredibly difficult to navigate. I know getting lost can sometimes be the point of these games but when you can't discern one area from another</review>
      <review>it just becomes a frustrating experience. I did still get some enjoyment from hunting down all the metroids despite the repetition. I'm glad to have played through it but any revisit will be through either of the remakes."</review>
      <review>'Mucho mejor que la primera entrega'</review>
      <review>"If there ever was some good to come out of the NSO service</review>
      <review>it would be the new opportunity to find out just how much Game Boy games rule. After enjoying\n \n Wario Land 4\n \n</review>
      <review>the Japanese app's catalog planning to include the never localized\n \n The Frog for Whom the Bell Tolls\n \n was the kick I needed to finally find it on the information superhighway</review>
      <review>and it was a blast too. The misadventures of the Prince of Sable (Note that hurts me to write: the Assist Trophy guy that turns into a frog) got me thinking about how the console's library tends to stick out from a lot of Nintendo's usual lineup. I was originally going to write something longer about that game itself</review>
      <review>pointing to how Game Boy games having a smaller technical scope</review>
      <review>and perhaps a looser leash than their console counterparts</review>
      <review>could enable them to explore more unique narratives. In particular</review>
      <review>the role of the protagonist is oddly subversive across the library. The aforementioned and often incompetent Prince of Sable</review>
      <review>the way in which the\n \n Mario Land\n \n series was supplanted by its own antagonist</review>
      <review>or even the bittersweet nature of Link's quest in\n \n Link's Awakening\n \n . But I could never really get beyond that thesis statement. Sure</review>
      <review>I could point out how telling it was that the Prince had to buy his own transformation items</review>
      <review>but nothing ever came together in an interesting way."]</review>

    <summary>"He shall appear from a far Eastern land across the sea. A young man who has yet to know his potential. This potential is a power that can either destroy him, or realize his will. His courage shall determine his fate. The path he must traverse, fraught with adversity, I await whilst praying. For this destiny predetermined since ancient times... A pitch, black night unfolds with the morning star as its only light. And thus the saga, begins..." This first chapter of Shenmue kicks off Yu Suzuki's cinematic Dreamcast tour-de-force, an exploration-heavy adventure that has players immerse themselves in Yokosuka, Japan. Players slip into the role of a young martial artist named Ryo Hazuki, who is on the trail of his father's killer. On the way, players must talk with hundreds of characters, engage in martial arts battles, and marvel at the realistic depiction of the Japanese coastal town.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>['Shenmue is definitely a game that will never be made again</review>
      <review>and I mean that in both a good and a bad way. The amount of attention to detail that this game had in 1999 is unparalleled for it\'s time. It truly is Yu Suzuki\'s magnum opus as he decided to create a virtual living breathing community of people</review>
      <review>and in a lot of ways he succeeded. Because of the less traditional approach that was made to create this game</review>
      <review>a less traditional mindset needs to be had to really enjoy this kind of game ngl. I think a good modern equivalent would be something like death stranding</review>
      <review>a game where if you are able to slow down to the pace that the game asks of you</review>
      <review>there\'s a lot to be had in the sort of atmospheric sense</review>
      <review>but if you are going into the game expecting to play it like any other game</review>
      <review>focusing on major goals and objectives as skillfully and efficiently as possible</review>
      <review>then you are probably gonna be really bored and frustrated at the game. And that\'s not me trying to say "if you have that kind of mindset</review>
      <review>you wouldn\'t understand shenmue"</review>
      <review>but more me saying "this game is not for everyone and you should definitely know that going in if you want to experience this game to its fullest". You gotta play on the game\'s terms</review>
      <review>and not really on your own</review>
      <review>in that sense. The gameplay just revolves asking people various things to get various hints on where to go next</review>
      <review>and once you go to the next place you ask the people in that place where to go</review>
      <review>and the cycle continues until you piece together the greater picture of whats going on. My reccomendation is just to give it a shot</review>
      <review>and you will probably know within the first few hours whether or not the game is for you.'</review>
      <review>'The entire game is a slog</review>
      <review>but in the best way possible.'</review>
      <review>'Played the HD remaster on Steam Deck for this one. Despite being an older game that’s definitely showing its age</review>
      <review>it still feels so grand - to the point where the ending gave me chills.'</review>
      <review>'Shenmue is a wild adventure</review>
      <review>and I’m not just talking about what happens in-game. This classic is the quintessential showcase of ambition in the game sphere</review>
      <review>as well as how those ambitions eventually ran up against insurmountable limitations.'</review>
      <review>'had a deep obsession with this game for a while when I was like 12'</review>
      <review>"Genuinely one of the best video games I've ever played</review>
      <review>a time capsule of a video game that would later lead to being incredibly influential in ways most probably wouldn't think of in its gameplay and story structure. Full of cheesy charm</review>
      <review>cozy vibes</review>
      <review>great characters and a soapy but fantastic narrative. There is nothing quite like Shenmue."]</review>

Each of the main races are against 7 other AI competitors with 5 boss races. There are also a few arcade modes up to 4 players.</summary>

The game now features full 3D graphics and character models, allowing more dynamic camera angles during gameplay, such as quickly panning around the courtroom in the moments before a dramatic reveal. The 3D camera also allows investigation sequences to take place in 3D spaces, permitting greater investigative depth, such as being able to rotate around a room to look for clues.</summary>

The game retain many gameplay elements from Link's Awakening such as the graphics, audio and top-view perspective. It also features eight dungeons and a large overworld to explore like in the previous games. Oracle of Seasons is said to be more action-oriented than its counterpart being more puzzle-oriented. After completing one of the two games, both can be linked to form a single linear plot with an alternate ending. Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages were often credited as being two of the top games for the Game Boy Color.</summary>

      <review>All the GOW are kinda that so...If you look at that game Just as a "game" and not a part of a whole saga of GOW</review>
      <review>you Will enjoy much more.\n \n 8</review>

      <review>"To put it shortly</review>
      <review>this game sucks. As for my reasoning; the camera being semi-fixed camera angles whilst being extremely far away at times made it excruciatingly difficult to see where I was. couple that with some encounters having 2 or more enemies 3 times the size of Kratos and I cannot see/defend myself. The story in this game is a very slow burn and was very confusing in the beginning as this is the first (technically second since I started GoW 2018 but decided to play the other games first) GoW. The puzzles I mostly to be enjoyable but some took a bit of time. The enemies in this game were probably the most annoying part. A lot of them couldn't be grabbed leaving you to just smack them over and over and</review>
      <review>most of the time</review>
      <review>they usually have super armor. Fortunately</review>
      <review>as the game progressed I got more tools to counter these cancerous enemies but early game was... a struggle</review>
      <review>to put it lightly."</review>
      <review>"Unfortunately this game can't ascend over a 2 1/2 star rating."</review>
      <review>'God of War... again. I\'m glad the series took a new direction because the formula of "kratos is so mad he kills gods" got old fast</review>
      <review>although this game is fun and does well with the original formula as is</review>
      <review>just really repetitive.'</review>

    <summary>The story of Xenosaga III starts a year after "Xenosaga II" ended.

She instead joins Scientia, an underground organization working to unveil Vector's secrets in order to bring them down. Uncover the truth and save mankind in the finale of the Xenosaga series which boasts over 3 hours of movies, an updated battle system, and an improved customization feature with more in-depth character specialization and diversification and higher rewards for strategic party management.

      <review>'A true masterpiece'</review>
      <review>'this has truly been a xenosaga'</review>
      <review>'Ah</review>
      <review>xenosaga 3. The circumstances around this game are so dire that it could have been the second coming of christ (and in a few ways it\n \n literally\n \n is) and it would still be fighting an uphill battle. So to put things into perspective here</review>
      <review>xenosaga was originally planned to be this super megaseries that had a bunch of installments and episodes to tell this grandiose pre-written story. The problem was</review>
      <review>xenosaga 2 kinda turbo bombed both commercially and critically because that game was hot ass (not the good kind) so those plans got cut short</review>
      <review>with this game basically having the pacing of "oh shit we have one game left to tell the rest of this story here"</review>
      <review>so things are retconned like crazy and the plot is overall just all over the place. As a game though</review>
      <review>there\'s plenty here to enjoy</review>
      <review>mechanically it\'s solid</review>
      <review>and visually it\'s great. The problem is by the time I got around to playing this I was so turned off by xenosaga due to how bad game 2 was that I really wasn\'t able to get as on board as I could or should have been for this one</review>
      <review>and that\'s kinda a shame. I wouldn\'t really say to try playing this in a vacuum or to skip 2 since these 3 games are so intrinsically linked with one another</review>
      <review>so I just think this game is just in an unfortunate position where it\'s a good game</review>
      <review>but just in a place so dire that it\'s hard to look back on it with very much fondness besides "wow</review>
      <review>that was a game series of all time"'</review>
      <review>"It's worth playing the trilogy JUST to get to this game. I only beat this game yesterday but I can see this game sticking with me for a long time"</review>

      <review>kirby\'s dreamland 2</review>
      <review>had more demanding and frankly ridiculous puzzles to solve</review>
      <review>dreamland 3 here makes it more intuitive in finding out what you have to do. the puzzles follow a similar structure from world-to-world</review>
      <review>and whenever you\'re in an important place the game is sure to make a little chime sound to tell you "hey</review>
      <review>puzzle here!"\n \n it\'s great</review>
      <review>and i love solving puzzles with my abilities to help the little characters in this game. it\'s fun!\n \n if they were to bring these puzzle elements into future games with the same combat mechanics we have now</review>

      <review>"Aesthetically wonderful with its colored pencil artstyle and great OST. Gameplaywise it is a definite slower vibe than something like superstar</review>
      <review>but it still has its own unique flow that can be exciting. I think the level objectives to get the heart stars make the levels more memorable and keep this from falling into the dreaded forgettable kirby game hole. Animal buddies are back and there are even new ones this time around! There's also multiplayer but only one person can ride an animal at a time which is lame. I think a lot of people like to be harsh on this game because it's not as good as super star but this games great in its own ways."]</review>

    <summary>Embark on a brand new adventure with Shantae, the hair-whipping belly dancing genie. When she loses her magic, Shantae must team up with her nemesis, the nefarious pirate Risky Boots in order to save Sequin Land from an evil curse. As a pirate, Shantae gains new weapons to advance her quest, slay monsters, battle epic bosses…and hopefully get her magic back in the bargain! But can she really trust her deadliest enemy? The third Shantae game is the biggest yet! Beyond Sequin Land lie cursed islands and labyrinths each hiding a new piece of Pirate Gear - Flintlock Pistol, Pirate Hat, Scimitar, Risky's Boots, and even a Cannon. Upgrade Shantae's hair and weapons or unlock advanced Fighter's Moves. Locate maps, return lost Heart Squids, collect rare loot, and laugh out loud at the weird, wild, and wonderfully humorous cast of characters. Incredible stereoscopic visuals, unlockable Pirate-Mode, multiple endings, and an unforgettable soundtrack make this one game you won't want to miss!</summary>

    <summary>Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is poised to bury mankind in a Tomb of Terror. Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosomes. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!</summary>

      <review>"Tras el esperpento de Simon's Quest por suerte Konami supo hacer autocrítico y volvió a los orígenes de Castlevania trayéndonos una verdadera secuela del primer juego con su alma bien representada y la fórmula mejorada con un guión y unos personajes (dentro de lo que cabe en su época y plataforma) carismáticos. El hecho de poder usar diferentes personajes ya hace que el juego sea mucho más divertido y variado que sus antecesores."]</review>

    <summary>The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel is a role-playing game and a part of the long running The Legend of Heroes series of games. The basic gameplay is nearly identical to the previous Kiseki series entries with a few changes. The biggest change to the battle system and also counting as a brand new feature is the "Tactical Link System". The "Tactical Link" allow players follow up with three different kinds of link attacks, dealing additional damage and providing various other benefits. "Tactical Link" becomes a more useful asset to the player as the story progress and characters level up their "Link Levels" with other characters. As the link levels increase, you will obtain new link abilities such as healing the link partner or increase the CP gain of the partner.</summary>

The removal of the grid allows you to be a little more creative with area of effect attacks. Its a small change</review>

    <summary>Pokémon LeafGreen Version and Pokémon FireRed Version are a pair of core series Generation III games that are set in the Kanto region. They were released in Japan on January 29, 2004, in North America on September 9, 2004, in Australia on September 23, 2004 and in Europe on October 1, 2004. As the first remakes in the Pokémon franchise, the games revisit the original pair of Pokémon games, Pokémon Red and Green Versions, and so feature all of the characters, plot elements, and challenges of them, but with several important upgrades to bring them up to speed with other Generation III games. The Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter was initially included with the games when they were first released, eliminating the need for Game Link Cables when trading between the two games (and later Pokémon Emerald Version). In later copies, it was sold separately. FireRed and LeafGreen went on to become the second best-selling games of the Game Boy Advance, only behind Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire Versions. They also received Nintendo's Player's Choice awards.</summary>

      <review>"While it is a refreshing take on what a new 3d Mario adventure might look like</review>
      <review>I think Bowser's Fury feels awkward in places. A lot of the islands levels that you can seemlessly travel to however you often need to leave and come back for some objectives. Fury Bowser was interesting at first</review>
      <review>but he became an annoyance later on</review>
      <review>often showing up at inconvenient times to prevent you from being able to complete an objective. I also don't think the 3D world control style and powerup system works too well for a more sandbox type of mario game. Your movement options don't feel as flexible as something like Super Mario Odyssey which feels uncomfortable at times for this game. This is likely a result of being a bonus mode for 3D World as opposed to being a standalone game. Overall its an interesting package</review>
      <review>and I don't regret buying 3D World again just for this."</review>

    <summary>A sequel to Street Fighter, Street Fighter II improved upon the many concepts introduced in the first game, including the use of command-based special moves and a six-button configuration, while offering players a selection of multiple playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style and special moves. Street Fighter II is credited for starting the fighting game boom during the 1990s. Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008. Street Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a "double KO" or "draw game" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match. After every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a "bonus game" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo. Like in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands. Street Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also "cancel" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.</summary>

    <summary>The story follows a nameless protagonist who lives in near-future Tokyo. When a portal to the realm of demons is opened, United States officials order a nuclear attack on Tokyo. Transported with two other supporting characters thirty years into the future, the protagonist finds the Earth ruined by a demon invasion, which is now the stage for an escalating conflict between the Order of Messiah and the Ring of Gaea, conflicting cults who wish to bring about kingdoms for their respective patron deities (YHVH and Lucifer). The story is influenced by moral decisions the protagonist makes, aligning him either with the Order, the Ring of Gaea, or setting him up as an independent agent. The gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies by talking to them rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons.</summary>

New vehicles like the ATV and a transport helicopter allow for all-new multiplayer tactics on the Battlefield. With the Frostbite-enabled Destruction 2.0 system, you can take down entire buildings and create your own fire points by blasting holes through cover. You can also compete in four-player teams in two squad-only game modes, fighting together to unlock exclusive awards and achievements. Battles are set across expansive maps, each with a different tactical focus. The game also sees the return of the B Company squad in a more mature single-player campaign.</summary>

    <summary>The Walking Dead: A New Frontieris an episodic graphic adventure game based on Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead comic book series developed by Telltale Games. It is Telltale's third season of its The Walking Dead series. The game employs the same narrative structure as the past seasons, where player choice in one episode will have a permanent impact on future story elements. The player choices recorded in save files from the first two seasons and the additional episode "400 Days" carry over into the third season. Clementine, who was the player's companion during the first season and the player-character in season two returns as a player-character along with another player-character, Javier "Javi" Garcia. The game takes place in the same fictional world as the comic, with the zombie apocalypse having occurred. The main characters of the game are original characters, however due to time skips in season two and between seasons two and three, the timeline is caught up to where the comics are.</summary>

    <summary>A reinvention of the original NES titles with revamped graphics and intuitive touch control, Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon will finally introduce longtime fans to the stories that gave birth to the series nearly 20 years ago in Japan, while introducing the Fire Emblem franchise to a broader audience of strategy and chess fans. Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon also reveals the back story of Marth, the original lead character in the Fire Emblem series introduced and made popular in North America by the Super Smash Bros. series of fighting games.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["Prime example that sometimes being too faithful to the original isn't inherently a good thing."</review>

      <review>and I like that. It doesn't waste your time with overly-excessive dialogue or humongous maps. It keeps everything brief</review>
      <review>which I feel fits the handheld nature of the game pretty well. The characters and story aren't anything special</review>
      <review>but there are some parts of it that are surprisingly well-written (Nyna and Minerva my beloveds). Definitely one of the better FE games."</review>

Step into an oddly placed shop to buy some helpful items or level up between caverns to battle well dwelling monsters and uncover hidden caves filled with riches and relics.

      <review>but anyone rating it higher than like 3.5 stars maximum just doesn’t remember they were seven when they played this. surprising variety of enemy types</review>
      <review>but the bosses are all a little too easy.'</review>
      <review>"genuinely solid cult classic 3D platformer collectathon type deal set in the spongebob world. I didn't play this one growing up</review>
      <review>but I did play the spongebob movie game back then which was essentially the sequel to this game so I knew what I was signing up for going in. Honestly I think I like this game a little bit more than the movie game</review>
      <review>and wish I had played it growing up since this game explores a lot more of the locales in the spongebob universe than its sequel does. Also there are more playable characters. This game got remade</review>
      <review>but I have heard that the remake was rather mid so idk maybe play the original instead?"</review>
      <review>"It's okay if you never watched the show</review>
      <review>this game is just a really good collectathon."</review>
      <review>'Well SpongeBob SquarePants</review>
      <review>that truly was a Battle for Bikini Bottom'</review>

      <review>not back then since i was still a fucking sperm cell at the time but back in 2020</review>
      <review>we obviously had Covid fucking everything up</review>
      <review>so we had to stay at home for a few months</review>
      <review>I modded my Wii just in time so i could finally touch some games that i had on my Backlog for while</review>

      <review>everytime i would finish some work i'd play hours upon hours of this game</review>
      <review>evene beating the final boss and 100% the game</review>
      <review>so revisiting this game keep in mind this sorta bias."</review>

      <review>and I have played almost all of them. I don’t know if this was the original game because I played the collection version on my Xbox One</review>

      <review>the characters icons were missing. Then I figured it out</review>
      <review>but they should have already had the icons up when we first started. Also</review>
      <review>the broom that you use for one gold brick was missing until it appeared again when I had collected ever last gold brick except that one. Another glitch I found was that I was able to become Snape in free play by selecting Harry once</review>
      <review>filter two times</review>
      <review>and press A. I admit I used it so much just so I didn’t have to unlock him back at Hogwarts. I play the missions on free play after I finish the movie. Other than those</review>
      <review>the only other glitches I found were characters getting stuck in levels</review>

      <review>much akin to how Ocarina of Time was followed by Majora's Mask. But this isn't the low-polygon era of the 90's anymore</review>
      <review>and even a sequel made in the same engine as BotW wasn't going to take less than two years as OoT did. Still</review>
      <review>it wouldn't make sense not to capitalize on the massive success of BotW in the meantime. Then there was the Hyrule Warriors series</review>
      <review>a musou-style title which had its first entry on the Wii U</review>
      <review>and was ported to the Switch to decent success. In that case</review>
      <review>the stars kind of aligned</review>
      <review>and 3 years after Breath of the Wild</review>
      <review>a sequel to Hyrule Warriors-and a prequel to Breath of the Wild-was released with the title Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Calamity."</review>
      <review>"I played this game a lot later</review>
      <review>like last week and I found this game to be very enjoyable and I know it has some faults but comparing it to Three Hopes just made the game that much more enjoyable to me</review>
      <review>speaking strictly story wise anyways</review>
      <review>I liked that the story wasn't super predictable and that everything ended up being alright and branching off to a different timeline that doesn't really affect the main one."</review>
      <review>'Enjoativo e repetitivo como qualquer Musou que eu joguei. Mas esse aqui tecnicamente falando é o melhor que eu já joguei</review>
      <review>tem bastante coisas pra fazer e liberar e as mecânicas são bem legais</review>
      <review>apesar de ser repetitivo'</review>
      <review>'I like the gameplay</review>
      <review>I LOVE the world and seeing how things around Hyrule looked before Breath of the Wild but the entire experience was horribly soiled by the "twist" more than halfway in. It completely ruined my opinion of this game and contradicted what some of the marketing was claiming. The 4 stars I\'m giving is generous compared to how I really feel.'</review>
      <review>"A great game for fans of Breath of the Wild it seems. You get to play all your favorite characters and defeat hordes of enemies with stunningly flashy attack moves. I never played BotW</review>
      <review>but I'm glad I played this one. The graphics are great</review>
      <review>the music is fine and the gameplay is fun</review>
      <review>mindlessly so."]</review>

    <summary>Initially released in Japan in 1993, Secret of Mana took the world by storm with its innovative real-time battle system and gorgeously rendered world. It continues to stand out among other action RPGs for its seamless gameplay that anyone from beginner to veteran can enjoy. One of the most memorable elements of the Mana series is the Ring Command menu system. With the single press of a button, a ring-shaped menu appears on the screen, where players can use items, change weapons, and do a variety of other actions without needing to switch screens. This Ring Command menu system for which the Mana series is so well known was first introduced in Secret of Mana and has since appeared in most games in the series. Play as Randi and his two companions, Primm and Popoi, as they adventure all around the world. At the center of our epic story is the mystical power of Mana. Battle the empire in its quest for control of Mana. Befriend the eight elementals who wield the forces of nature itself. Numerous encounters await at every turn.</summary>

      <review>"Charming little game that's easy on the eyes with a sharp atmosphere thanks to some excellent art direction. Comes up a bit short for me past the first few hours though as the novelty wears off and the woefully repetitive one-trick soundtrack starts to grate on. The art direction alone could have almost carried this one for me but a game so adept at a very cozy medieval cottage atmosphere really shouldn't have me as anxious as it does about maximizing of every ingredient I use. The garden simply doesn't provide as much of the bare necessities</review>
      <review>and the vendors and their prices are too seldom and random to be as meaningful as they probably should be. Run-of-the-mill simple potions frequently eat up basic ingredients and tumble the balancing act against exploring the map and hunting down new ones for the more demanding patrons. A solid improvement would be to include a static vendor that might sacrifice a day of patrons without a status or moral penalty</review>
      <review>but lets you buy out a fixed amount of basic ingredients you'd like to have on hand</review>
      <review>or better yet a methodology around upgrading the magic garden to increase the amount of those basic ones."</review>

      <review>I'm mad I played this I died on the ending fight like 3 times idk why they boot you back to the starting screen when you die no other xeno game has done that and it pissed me off having to fight the first phase all 3 times I looked up the last cutscene on youtube and I'm glad cause I didn't miss anything cause the ending is just kinda there no main message we just defeat the fog king who might I add is the worst villain ever</review>
      <review>the Xeno series is so heavy on it's characters and that stays true for the villains ESPECIALLY the Villains so it's insane that we just have this random entity be the big bad it should have been the racist dude insane that he just disappears out of the story by the way. gameplay wise it blows character wise it sucks the whole racist theme they had for a while can kick rocks I don't know why they gave the pen to some stranger but GOD forbid they ever do anything like this again"</review>

Featuring nonstop action rendered at 60 frames-per-second, signature and upgradable weapons, attack combos and mana-fueled spells and the choice of punishing or absolving the souls of defeated enemies, it is a classic Medieval tale of the eternal conflict with sin and the resulting horrors of hell, adapted for a new generation and a new medium.</summary>

Beat the Stadium Mode and you're in for a bonus battle against the ultimate Pokémon warrior, Mewtwo, as well as a secret mode that gives you 80 brand-new, and devilishly tough battles. There is virtually no way you can beat the secret mode without having trained your own, elite Pokémon. One to four players compete against each other or the computer in a no-holds-barred battle with customizable rules. You can select rental Pokémon for these battles -- but that makes them much too predictable since their selection of techniques isn't determined by the trainer.

    <summary>Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 is a Japanese tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo, and the fifth installment in the Fire Emblem series. It is also the third and final Fire Emblem series title to be released on the Super Famicom. Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 takes place between Chapters 5 and 6 of the previous game, Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu. Several characters from Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu appear, such as Leaf, Fin, and Nanna. It takes place in the Thracian peninsula in southeastern Jugdral.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["There's genuinely nothing funny I could say about Thracia</review>
      <review>or anything that hasn't already been said about it that would do it justice. There's no other FE game that matches its raw gameplay integrity and absolutely genius ideas</review>
      <review>with Genealogy at least coming in close second. For every bullshit thing the game throws at you</review>
      <review>the game gives you quadruple the amount of bullshit to use against the enemy - like there are so many brave and master weapons and staves that basically get handed to you on a silver platter</review>
      <review>and while there are a few chapters that are trial and error</review>
      <review>actually figuring them out genuinely feels so good - no other Fire Emblem game gives me this much dopamine. Hell</review>
      <review>I made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game</review>
      <review>going in depth on every strategy I utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play. I think it's worth mentioning that this is the first time a game has compelled me to do something like this."</review>
      <review>'amei as mecânicas do jogo espero que apareça em outros jogos ou algum futuro remake me diverti bem mais com esse comparado com o fe4\n \n envelheceu bem demais e algum dia vou revisitar mesmo com toda raiva que passei em alguns mapas'</review>
      <review>"I'm never touching this game for the rest of my life. I have never felt such hatred inside of me until I played this game. The story and characters really carry this game. Take me back to Genealogy please. Also</review>
      <review>fuck the ballistae in this game."</review>
      <review>"It's the kind of game that will kick in the stomach</review>
      <review>laugh and continue to kick you</review>
      <review>until it's get tired</review>
      <review>but when it does</review>
      <review>it will extend you a hand and treat you like a hero. Play it if you have some experience with tactical games otherwise you will have a bad time."</review>
      <review>'Oh my God. I can’t believe I slept on this game/ kept it for last thinking it would be too hard for me. Despite being on the SNES</review>
      <review>it’s an absolute masterpiece of a game</review>
      <review>which can be attributed to the fact it tests the SNES to its limits</review>
      <review>being the final SNES game ever made</review>
      <review>released in 1999</review>
      <review>nine years after the SNES’s inception</review>
      <review>and 3 years into the N64’s lifespan. Shouzou Kaga was evidently opposed to making a Fire Emblem game on the N64</review>
      <review>believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters</review>
      <review>and that philosophy to keep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1’s Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles. That too went well</review>
      <review>but let’s focus on FE5.'</review>
      <review>'This game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it</review>
      <review>the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half</review>
      <review>but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful</review>
      <review>to say the least. Still</review>
      <review>after strategizing for hours</review>
      <review>constantly saving and loading states and rage moments</review>
      <review>sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remarkable\n \n Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it. While FE4 had it\'s fair share of dark moments</review>
      <review>this game is straight up depressing</review>
      <review>you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. By the beggining of the game</review>
      <review>you feel completely lost</review>
      <review>and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty</review>
      <review>just like Leif</review>
      <review>feeling lost on this brutal war. You are not a group of experienced and heroic knights</review>
      <review>leading for victory</review>
      <review>you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire</review>
      <review>and you\'re obviously going to get obliterated against such force. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units</review>
      <review>a hope slowly rises</review>
      <review>and you go from "how the hell am i going to survive from this?" to "Hey</review>
      <review>i can actually do this!" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. And then</review>
      <review>you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire. It\'s actually even harder then before</review>
      <review>but you have so much more experince with the game</review>
      <review>you don\'t feel as powerless as before. And after you\'ve gone through so much</review>
      <review>beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n \n This</review>
      <review>is phenomenal storytelling</review>
      <review>and you can only have this in a videogame</review>
      <review>that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. That\'s why remake of this game is probably going to suck</review>
      <review>since they\'ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.\n \n Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management</review>
      <review>and i love this</review>
      <review>you can capture enemies to steal their equipment</review>
      <review>but it\'s significantly harder and risky to do</review>
      <review>since you\'ll deal much less and take much more damage. But since you don\'t get much chance to buy and repair weapons</review>
      <review>you really have to pay attention the resources you have</review>
      <review>and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n \n Fatigue is also a new mechanic</review>
      <review>which if you use a unit too much</review>
      <review>you won\'t be able to use them in the next chapter</review>
      <review>which makes powerful units more tricky to use</review>
      <review>adding another depth to the gameplay. You\'ll only want to use them when necessary</review>
      <review>so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units</review>
      <review>i gotta say this was hard to get used to</review>
      <review>especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4</review>
      <review>but it didn\'t took long to for me to actually like it\n \n Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller</review>
      <review>but focused maps with multiple objectives</review>
      <review>and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. You have defense</review>
      <review>escape</review>
      <review>fog of war(which isn\'t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. Also each map has it\'s own unique objective</review>
      <review>which makes every single map even more memorable. Varied objectives makes each chapter fresh</review>
      <review>which is something i\'ve never seen in an SRPG\n \n Weakest part of this game imo are the characters</review>
      <review>in FE4</review>
      <review>you have a lot of optional conversations between characters</review>
      <review>and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit</review>
      <review>in FE5</review>
      <review>most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most</review>
      <review>and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.\n \n But i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n \n Though this doesn\'t mean that this game has no good character writing</review>
      <review>far from it</review>
      <review>Leif is one the best written main character\'s i\'ve ever seen in a game. Like i mentioned before</review>
      <review>you start of the game as powerless</review>
      <review>and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. Just like Leif</review>
      <review>who\'s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. This is obviously no coincidence</review>
      <review>Leif represents the player</review>
      <review>but unlike most games that have a main character which is"representing the player"Leif isn\'t a silent protagonist</review>
      <review>his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural</review>
      <review>and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player</review>
      <review>as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n \n I\'m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4</review>
      <review>but still</review>
      <review>this is one the finest SRPG\'s ever made. It\'s frusturating for sure</review>
      <review>but it\'s so well designed in nearly every aspect</review>
      <review>it\'s impossible for me to hate it. I\'d highly recommend it if you liked FE4</review>
      <review>and simply want to see more from this world.']</review>

Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you. You have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen.

      <review>['I have no words</review>
      <review>honestly. Peak'</review>
      <review>'Assim como sua "prequel"</review>
      <review>Nier: Automata é um jogo quase que impecável. Um dos seus pontos mais fortes com certeza é a sua lore espetacular acompanhada de personagens envolventes e muito bem desenvolvidos conforme o desenrolar da trama. Além de ter uma estética incrível e uma gameplay divertida e diversificada.\n \n Apesar do jogo ter a mesma problemática em relação ao design de personagens femininas</review>
      <review>a parte em que o jogo peca profundamente é o sistema de Levels. Claramente dá pra ver que essa mecânica é extremamente desbalanceada e sem sentido pro jogo</review>
      <review>ou você é muito fraco ou você é extremamente forte em comparação á TODOS os inimigos</review>
      <review>o jogo não tem um scaling para os inimigos acompanharem o seu progresso nos levels</review>
      <review>deixando uma discrepância grave d poder na maioria das vezes.\n \n Porém</review>
      <review>mesmo assim</review>
      <review>sinto que o jogo não mereça uma nota menor do que 10</review>
      <review>as partes que o jogo peca são fortes sim</review>
      <review>mas não o bastante para ofuscar a enorme "masterpiece" que é Nier: Automata. Termino minha análise convicto que este jogo definitivamente é um "must-play" para quem aprecia videogames num geral.'</review>

      <review>was absolute hot garbage; it was done dirty and needed absolutely to be done better for the fans of the series who shelled out\n \n more\n \n money for a game they'd potentially purchased one or more times. That said</review>
      <review>I'll itemize why this port was terrible:"</review>
      <review>'+ scifi story at its best\n \n + characters you get attached to\n \n + the music and its variants and the times it is cued to play\n \n + hacking and how it is integrated into the story/whenever the UI itself is messed up\n \n + difficulty settings</review>
      <review>being able to pick and choose from the auto chips\n \n - targeting hacking and bullets can be wacky when there are multiple enemies</review>
      <review>literally makes it harder having auto chips on\n \n - more quests and things to do would have been nice but the ones that are there are alright']</review>

    <summary>Sonic and the Secret Rings is a three-dimensional platform and action game featuring an on-rails style of movement. Sonic the Hedgehog, the series' main character, is the game's only player character. He is controlled exclusively with the Wii Remote, which is held horizontally like a traditional gamepad.</summary>
    <reviews>
      <review>["This has one of the STUPIDEST game design choices I've ever seen. Having to BUY good controls doesn't make for a fun experience</review>
      <review>it just becomes frustrating. The only thing I can maybe praise is the OST. That aside</review>
      <review>this game is not worth it."</review>
      <review>"This game is very easy not to like. It has one of the craziest motion control mechanics grazed on a platformer and Sonic's movement at the beginning course of the game is not great. Slow acceleration</review>
      <review>slow jumps</review>
      <review>and over sensitive maneuvering becomes intially apparent and it doesn't help that you have to slowly keep unlocking better maneuvering mechanics as well as other beneficial abilities that you won't get until at least midgame unless you decide to replay levels over and over and over</review>
      <review>or grind out through exciting filler stages like clear this stage with 0 rings and kill 1 enemy etc."</review>
      <review>"This game ain't it. The plot is okay and the game looks decent and sounds great</review>
      <review>but the controls are so bad the whole thing is barely playable. Theres a lot of emphasis on motion controls with the wii remote and they want you to be precise with em when the controls themselves are as imprecise as possible. Kinda like super monkey ball banana blitz except at least that game felt like the levels were designed around the new control scheme to a degree. Instead of doing regular levels in a linear order like literally every sonic game before it</review>
      <review>this game has you do a bunch of scattered mini-objectives in order to progress</review>
      <review>except even then its not entirely obvious which ones you need to do to actually proceed. The vibes are on point for sure</review>
      <review>but it's not really a game I'd want to go back to. Even kid me didn't like this one."</review>

Time passes in Animal Crossing in real-time, as the month, day, season, and time of day matches that of the player's. Holiday seasons come and go in Animal Crossing, just as they would in the real world.

    <summary>“Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon” is packed with the retro charm that made the legendary 2D action games of the 80s so enjoyable. Take control of one of four characters that can be interchanged at any time during gameplay: The sword-swinging exorcist Zangetsu, the whip-wielding heroine Miriam, the magic using alchemist Alfred, and Gebel, who can turn into a bat and take to the skies. Finally, you can experience multiple endings depending on how you interact with the characters you meet. This project is the 8-bit style game promised as a stretch goal of the 2015 Kickstarter campaign for "Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night." Backers of the Kickstarter campaign are encouraged to check the Kickstarter page for updates.</summary>

    <summary>FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 is created with the aim of surpassing the quality of its predecessor in every way, featuring new gameplay systems and cutting-edge visuals and audio. In this game the player has the freedom to choose from a range of possibilities and paths; where their choices affect not only the immediate environment, but even shape time and space!</summary>

      <review>["Oh boy. Playing the XIII series is looking more and more like a mistake. It's...fine? It's not as linear as XIII which makes it a little more fun but by the final stretch</review>
      <review>I'm just tired. The combat isn't enough to hold up the story which seems needlessly convoluted and doesn't feel like it's really going anywhere. Maybe I'm missing something cause about halfway through I started to zone out when the characters started talking. So yeah</review>
      <review>it's okay. The ending (which I watched) makes the game seem a little pointless.\n \n Overall</review>
      <review>it's fine I guess. I'm done."</review>
      <review>'So like XIII I also platinumed XIII-2.'</review>
      <review>'a marked improvement over 13-1 with alot more things to do and sights to see. exploration has been improved drastically with there actually being shit to do other than fight! wow! seeing a bunch of locations from the first game in different time periods and seeing how they begin</review>
      <review>and end is a great feature and an interesting way to justify reuse of assets. the characters were interesting to me</review>
      <review>and I was really hoping noel would get to see Yeul again. at the same time Caius has a great motivation and I kind of wanted him to win too! the combat system here is one of my favorites in the series. being able to use monsters as your third-party member allows for tons of variety. the plot can get pretty confusing at times however and the ending was wildly unsatisfying. but all in all it might just be my favorite in the trilogy'</review>
      <review>"shouldn't have smoked that shit now i'm in oerba 300 -AF-"</review>
      <review>'Gets an extra half-star for nostalgic reasons.\n \n Very conflicted on this game. It was not needed and if you learn more about how they had plans for multiple games as part of the "crystallis" collection then you start to connect the dots as to how we ended up with a game with so much potential. If you were to have a new cast of characters to play with but in the same world as FF13 it would make more sense and not trash the original. You could still have characters from the original game show up as NPCs. This helps connect the worlds. But Serah and Lightning could\'ve been replaced.'</review>
      <review>"my stars are because of nostalgia about the time i played this</review>
      <review>don't get your hopes up</review>
      <review>the story is messy at best and the gameplay is... something"]</review>

    <summary>Agar.io is a Massively-multiplayer top-down strategy browser game. In Agar.io, the player manipulates a circular cell using the mouse and keyboard buttons. The goal of the game is to enlarge the cell by swallowing non-player cells which are randomly scattered around the map. Other players that have smaller cells than the player are also able to be swallowed. Originally a browser game, Agar.io entered Steam Greenlight and was subsequently "Greenlit" by the community, with the developers indicating that they planned to add more features not available in the web version of the game. Agar.io has quickly become popular worldwide. Before the Turkish 2015 elections, Agar.io has been used in Turkey for political reasons; some political parties have also used Agar.io in campaign posters as a symbol of support. Players can also use skins.</summary>

The story follows twin sisters Mio and Mayu as they explore an abandoned village and experience encounters with the paranormal. Players must use the Camera Obscura to defeat ghosts and uncover the secrets of the village. An Xbox port, subtitled Director's Cut, was released in 2004 and included additional features. a remake of the game titled Project Zero 2: Wii Edition was released for the Wii in 2012 in Europe and Japan.</summary>

      <review>['Pretty cool albeit a bit similar to the first game. Still got them cult shenanigans. The plot was definitely more interesting this time around since its about twins getting involved with the aforementioned cult shenanigans. The combat is a bit better than the first but still can be a bit annoying with ghosts clipping through walls n such. The game is also separated into a bunch of smaller mansions rather than one big mansion. If you liked the first one you cant do wrong here either.'</review>

    <summary>Metal Gear is considered to be the progenitor of the stealth game genre, it was also the first video game designed by Hideo Kojima, who also directed many of the later Metal Gear sequels. A heavily altered port was produced for the Famicom/NES (without Kojima's involvement). A remade version based on the original MSX2 game was released as a bonus game in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 and, as a result, is also included in Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection. The game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world. The player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the "Alert Mode." In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery: If Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen. However, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator. The player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters. The enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank. A transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake's allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies' frequency numbers in order to contact them. All of the radio messages are dependent on the rooms where the player is located.</summary>

    <summary>Fable 2 is the second game in the fable series by Lionhead Studios, it is an open world role-playing game. It has a simple story line where the hero needs to save Albion from the evil Lord Lucian by collecting together the other three heroes to defeat him. Interactive cut-scenes are a large part of the game however the main character never speaks and all dialogue is uncontrolled. The game features a large variety of game play and freedom, allowing a player to shape the world around and the characters appearance and moral standing based on decisions throughout the game. The player can also get married both same and opposite sex and bring up children to childhood but no farther, expressions are a lot more interactive with NPC's than before</summary>

      <review>['A vibrant world and an expansion on systems from fable 1 make this a great sequel for fans of the first game. It is an acquired taste though and if you’re not a fan of burping on your wife so that you can get a present you probably won’t like fable 2.'</review>
      <review>'This game is definitely an upgrade to the original</review>
      <review>but not by much. You become overpowered if you do the tiniest amount of "grinding" - eg doing a job and then being able to afford the best items quickly.\n \n The sense of humour holds this game up from being totally terrible as it contains some great British talent</review>
      <review>like Steven Fry.\n \n The story feels thrown together - with limited options with how you can actually effect the story other than "do good thing" or "do bad thing".\n \n The menu system is really bad</review>
      <review>along with a pretty much non existent map makes the world hard to feel immersed in.\n \n The combat becomes very repetitive and pointless after a few hours.\n \n We had to force ourselves through the last few hours of the game.\n \n The cut scenes were pretty cool though.\n \n Not as much charm as the original Fable but updated mechanics made it feel a bit nicer to play. Hoping Fable 3 is better'</review>
      <review>"One of the main things I remember about Fable II is waiting the whole game until I got cool armor. The armor never showed up so that's kinda how I feel about this game. There is a doggy at least."</review>
      <review>"The actual content of the game is great</review>
      <review>but the game is very oversaturated in bloom</review>

      <review>at least on an Xbox Series X. I tried stomaching that and low framerates</review>

      <review>having more bits which improves detail while maintaining the original's groovy retro feel (also makes animations with more frames look better since they have more pixels to work with)\n \n + Is more grounded but still somehow finds its way to make the lore even more complicatingly interesting and head-scratching (in a good way</review>
      <review>for the most part!) TL;DR</review>
      <review>it expands the original lore very well\n \n + Combat is focused much more on melee and lower-range attacks as opposed to the first game's projectiles</review>
      <review>which increases difficulty while keeping it fair\n \n + Progression and level design is focused in a more balanced way. The first one had a lot of vertical hallways like original Metroid games</review>
      <review>which this game practically eliminates by interconnecting different areas much more and revamping the fast travel system entirely"</review>
      <review>"I feel like it's a definite step down from the first game in terms of combat</review>
      <review>but the exploration is actually pretty fun despite the world being more linear."</review>
      <review>'ok gidio ama eh'</review>
      <review>'Everything felt quite incongruous. I’d explore only to find dead ends then just randomly find myself in a different biome that didn’t gel with anything around it.

      <review>and honestly playing this right after any other N64 game you can REALLY feel the difference.

      <review>I finally got around to actually finishing this game! It is a very charming experience</review>
      <review>with a lot of fun characters that you can meet and a threatened divorce that you gotta solve so thats fun. Biggest downside to this game is theres a lot of "what the hell am I supposed to do" moments as love de lic esque games are. But its charming enough that I would reccomend it. just don\'t spend hundreds of dollars on a physical copy.'</review>
      <review>"Unironically the cutest and most joyous game to play. This game takes childhood imagination to another level and makes for an incredible experience that I think everyone needs to play as a child (or adult whichever happens first). The sound design is FUCKING ETHEREAL. The music is so lively with such a nice bounce (unless you're in basement). Every character is memorable and adds something to the game. There are plenty of secrets and the game rewards you for exploring."</review>

Now, it is up to Mega Man and his friend Zero to defeat the terrorists, turn the gravity on, and keep the colony from crashing into the Earth. The gameplay is what fans of the series have come to expect: Mega Man must use his blasters and bombs to make his way through eight levels of running, jumping, and shooting action. If you decide to play as Zero, you will have to use a plasma sword and some cunning to get through the same levels. In either case, the characters will have to face tough bosses that have unique abilities. Once a boss is defeated, Mega Man and Zero can utilize the boss's talents. Only Mega Man and Zero can save the colony and the Earth in MEGA MAN X5.</summary>

    <summary>Mega Man 7 is an action platform video game developed and published by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the seventh game in the original Mega Man series. The game was released in Japan on March 24, 1995 and was localized later in the year in North America and Europe.</summary>

      <review>["I'm sorry mega man fans</review>
      <review>this game is rad. From the sprite work and the cool robot master designs. To the little references in some of the stages and how each robot master's power interacted with each stage. Fuck Inafune for that last wily capsule tho"</review>
      <review>"Wasn't too big on this one. The sprites were huge which makes it harder to dodge things</review>
      <review>which can make playing it a little bit difficult</review>
      <review>ESPECIALLY WITH THE FINAL BOSS WILY CAPSULE 7. The music and robot masters didn't really slap that much either. Visually it's definitely distinct due to it being on the super nintendo instead of the NES</review>
      <review>but as a game i wasn't vibin with this one as much. Stick to the 8-bit ones."</review>
      <review>"i feel like this one was going pretty strong until slash man's stage and the final boss. also though i didnt know this game had a shop until after i beat it so i may or may not be the dumb asshole here"</review>
      <review>'slightly biased because I grew up with these sprites when I was younger. had such a fun time playing this though</review>
      <review>turbo man is so cool'</review>
      <review>'middle child energy'</review>
      <review>'Mega Man 7 is a bit of a black sheep in how it feels and plays out. With Mega Man X proving a much greater commercial and critical success than 6 in early 1994</review>
      <review>I\'d assume they wanted to stick some elements of X into the next installment of the original series. The end result is this very "in-between" installment that doesn\'t know which design philosophy to stick to.']</review>

      <review>['Definitely has a unique sense of style</review>
      <review>but ultimately had less to say than TSC while intentionally making large sections of the game more tedious than it.'</review>
      <review>"Poor Sumio must've been starving this entire game"</review>
      <review>'Absolutely fascinating video game. Subverts expectations through gameplay in the kind of sense that the game is designed like an "anti-game". I think that while it is a totally valid opinion to see all the monotonous walking around from place to place and the absolutely bullshit story riddles that require you to sift through a neigh 50 page guidebook of literal nonsense in order to figure out what random backass code the game wants you to put in to proceed in the game and think that the game is not good due to it not being very fun or interesting</review>
      <review>as a lot of "mainstream" game reviews have said. But the weird thing is that I feel like the monotony and convolution is entirely intentional. The creators were aware of it. The game is aware of it. And the game uses those boring gameplay moments to craft its whole narrative around and it makes something really unique. Something fresh that I\'ve never really played before. And I think because of it</review>
      <review>the game is certainly worth trying out</review>
      <review>even if you don\'t see it through to the end.'</review>

    <summary>Join forces with expert investigator Professor Layton and ace attorney Phoenix Wright in this unbelievable crossover adventure! Find out what new twists they bring to the courtroom as they solve puzzles and debunk witnesses’ lies. Cross-examine multiple witnesses at the same time to uncover the mysteries of the magical city of Labyrinthia. In a medieval town where the people live in fear of witchcraft and those who wield it, Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright, along with their assistants Luke and Maya, join forces to face a perilous journey filled with harrowing mysteries that cannot be solved with mere logic. Investigate the city of Labyrinthia and gather information from its townspeople by solving puzzles, then prove your client’s innocence in court. In new group cross-examinations, you’ll pit one witness’ testimony against another’s to get the story straight, then literally rewrite history alongside the greatest puzzle-solving duo Labyrinthia has ever known.</summary>

      <review>I came back with deep sorrows instead of flowing joy.\n \n I enjoyed the fact subtanks were brought back and the new armors that can be unlocked. It makes the game feel more similar to megaman X which is a good thing to me.\n \n Anyway</review>
      <review>aside from all these new upgrades</review>
      <review>the level design is disgusting. What's this game's deal with instant death traps seriously ? Enemy placements are put in every akward spots which is frustrating as well...\n \n Anyway after struggling your way through the game you'd expect the final boss to live up to the challenge that was presented to you throughout the entirety of the game...But that's not what happened</review>
      <review>the final boss was piss easy and only took 1 attempt to beat.\n \n So yeah</review>
      <review>I was pretty disappointed and I hope Megaman Zero 3 will make up for the bad experience that was the second game."</review>

    <summary>Snatcher is a cyberpunk-themed graphic adventure game directed and written by Hideo Kojima and produced by Konami. The setting and story of Snatcher is heavily influenced by cyberpunk and science-fiction media, taking place in a large futuristic dystopian city. The story revolves around an investigator named Gillian Seed assigned to investigate a breed of bioroids known as "snatchers", who are killing humans and taking their place in society. The game is set in a primarily first person perspective and uses a menu-based interface that allows the protagonist to interact with his environment. The player can choose to "Look", "Investigate", "Talk", "Ask" and "Move" (in addition to other options) to acquire key items or receive vital information from other characters. The player can analyze items in Gillian's belongings or show it to other characters. During key points of the game's story, the player must pass shooting sequences to defend Gillian from assailants. These shooting segments use a 3x3 grid which the player can target to fire at enemies. A shooting trainer, called "Junker's Eyes", is accessible at Junker HQ that allows the player to measure their accuracy.</summary>

    <summary>In this vertical scrolling spaceship shooter, you control a ship that can change its polarity at will. As blue/white, the ship can easily destroy red/black enemies, and vice versa. Bullets of your polarity can be collected to fuel your energy gauge, but those opposite will kill you. Destroying an enemy ship causes them to fire revenge bullets which can be absorbed and fired back by the player. Different difficulties exist to change exactly how you interact with polarized points, or how they appear. It is the spiritual successor to Radiant Silvergun, featuring similar level and boss design, as well as it's buddhism inspired themes and aesthetics. Both are directed by Hiroshi Iuchi, who also composed Ikaruga's soundtrack.</summary>

Based on the original 2005 PC release, this classic is finally officially available in English with added Steamworks features such as achievements and cloud saving.</summary>

The boss fights are very enjoyable with tough but easy to learn patterns that make the fights challenging but fun. The boss design isn't quite as good as Origin with some fights being a little too easy and some boss patterns being awkward to read. Overall a solid entry in the series."</review>

As time progresses Alice loses touch with reality. She is institutionalized in Rutledge Asylum, where she is observed and treated by Dr. Heironymous Wilson. Alice's only possession in Rutledge is a stuffed rabbit. Ten years after Alice was committed to Rutledge, she finds herself sucked back into a Wonderland that has been twisted by her own broken mind. The White Rabbit summons Alice to aid a radically altered Wonderland, which became a twisted version of itself as it came under the horrible rule of the Queen of Hearts. The Cheshire Cat serves as Alice's companion throughout the game, frequently appearing to guide her with cryptic comments.</summary>

    <summary>The player has two primary weapon slots, a handgun slot and can carry up to eight grenades (all of the later Call of Duty games feature only two weapon slots; a sidearm will fill one of these slots). Weapons may be exchanged with those found on the battlefield dropped by dead soldiers.</summary>

    <summary>The genuine sequel to the original Armored Core. Thrown into the world of AC mechs, you must complete the objectives set for you by a range of different companies, each with a hefty pay packet attached. If the mission is completed, the money goes towards upgrades and repairs to your mech. The collection of items to upgrade your mech is fully stocked with weapons, defense systems, rocket packs and guidance systems to increase accuracy and speed. Certain missions require a particular upgrade for the mission to be completed correctly, so spending the cash wisely is important to your career. Once your mech is ready for battle, you can also take on a friend in arena mode, where one-on-one battles rage on for as long as you wish in huge outdoor areas.</summary>

    <summary>Fate/stay night is a Japanese visual novel, which was originally released as an adult game. A version of Fate/stay night rated for ages 15 and up titled Fate/stay night Réalta Nua was released later. Fate/stay night '​s gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears, representing either dialogue between the characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Often, players will come to a "decision point" where they are given the chance to choose from options displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. There are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all three plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction.</summary>

    <summary>In Duskers you pilot drones into derelict spaceships to find the means to survive and piece together how the universe became a giant graveyard. You are a drone operator, surrounded by old gritty tech that acts as your only eyes and ears to the outside world. What you hear comes through a remote microphone. What you see is how each drone sees the world. Motion sensors tell you something's out there, but not what. And when you issue commands, you do it through a command line interface.</summary>

      <review>as if you\'re perceptive</review>
      <review>you can guess who\'s on the otherside of a door</review>
      <review>or if an event is about to take place.\n \n The drones are unreliable and pretty brittle</review>
      <review>but are modular and can be equipped with different abilities like a turret</review>
      <review>a motion sensor</review>
      <review>or a computer interface. These loadouts give you the tools to tackle different parts of the ship you\'re looting</review>
      <review>and can impact how you respond to situations. It\'s this slow</review>
      <review>tense crawl throughout the ship as you try to gauge what rooms are safe and what are to be avoided</review>
      <review>where anything at any given moment can go wrong. A pipe could burst</review>
      <review>a meteor could smash into the room</review>
      <review>an airlock could open sending anything and everything not anchored into space</review>
      <review>or an enemy could crawl through a vent and start wrecking your dudes. Thankfully</review>
      <review>many of these situations can be risk mitigated with game knowledge and experience</review>

      <review>and you can either control drones through the terminal</review>
      <review>or pilot an individual one manually. It\'s a bit obtuse</review>
      <review>but it\'s implemented deliberately as to not be overbearing. In moments of relative ease</review>
      <review>it\'s not an issue. But once something unexpected happens and you need to get your drones out fast</review>
      <review>you need to be able to know how to get every drone where you want it as fast as possible. Thankfully</review>
      <review>there\'s some command shortcuts like "exit"</review>
      <review>which sends your buddies booking for the exit</review>
      <review>and you can also macro sets of commands if you really want to optimize things. It really adds to the tension</review>
      <review>and one unexpected situation can make an inexperienced drone operator lose his entire team.\n \n It\'s been ages since I\'ve played this game</review>

      <review>these games really do have a real cozy feeling to them that is very rare to achieve</review>
      <review>and even more impressive considering the tone that Control goes for is pure liminal. Control might just be one of the best looking modern games period</review>
      <review>and a true showcase as to how simplicity can achieve spectacular results. The brutalist architecture of The Oldest House gives way for lighting and camera tricks to take center stage</review>
      <review>and it creates some of the most striking visuals I’ve ever seen in a game. The game’s biggest set piece is literally one texture repeated on all the walls</review>

    <summary>Just because this battle fits in the palm of your hand doesn't mean the stakes are small. On the contrary, this all-or-nothing fight will have you accessing guns, grenades, launchers, and weaponry of all sorts. Players assume command of an army that's out to reclaim a world that's been broken up by warring factions. The battle map is essentially a grid, and moving units is like moving chess pieces on a board -- each of the units can move a specific amount of spaces within this grid, and can only attack at a certain distance from specific enemies. Advance Wars features more than 115 maps, a map editor, head-to-head play via link cable, and an easy-to-understand tutorial mode for beginners.</summary>

Reimu Hakurei can cover a wide area of the screen with weaker attacks, while Marisa Kirisame relies on her speed and power to make up for her thinner attack spread. The bombs show different behavior and damage depending on the character and type chosen. Unlike its predecessor, Mystic Square, Embodiment of Scarlet Devil comes with an "automatic item collection" feature, which allows you to collect all items on the screen by moving to the top of the screen if you are at full power, as well as a counter-bomb system, which allows you to avoid a fatal hit by using a bomb immediately. Though there are six total stages in the main game, playing on Easy will end the game after Stage 5.</summary>

It is the first fighting game to feature full 3D battles similar to the Budokai Tenkaichi series. Fighters can traverse the levels free-roaming in large spaces and can fight on ground, in the air and underwater. The game features spoken dialogue from a majority of main characters while in battle, and characters show facial expressions when they strike an opponent or take damage. Although limited, the players have some freedom to explore the planet Earth as it exists in the Dragon Ball universe along with a handful of other locations.</summary>

The Prince's repertoire of combat moves has been expanded into varying strings that allow players to attack enemies with more complexity than was possible in the previous game. Warrior Within has a darker tone than its predecessor adding in the ability for the Prince to dispatch his enemies with various finishing moves. In addition to the rewind, slow-down, and speed-up powers from The Sands of Time, the Prince also has a new sand power: a circular "wave" of sand that knocks down all surrounding enemies as well as damaging them.</summary>

The game is developed by Cardboard Computer (Jake Elliott, Tamas Kemenczy, and Ben Babbitt), and features an original electronic score by Ben Babbitt along with a suite of old hymns &amp; bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers.</summary>

      <review>'it\'s a lot like a programming project in that when you start out it\'s a ton of fun and there are so many opportunities and so much promise but then 10 hours later you want to strangle your past self for the terrible design decisions you made at the start that are Fucking Up the entire damn thing. and in that sense it\'s also really like a programming project</review>

    <summary>Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition features the bonus content from the PS2 version and has many alterations compared to previous ports, taking Wiimote aiming into account. The shooting mechanism uses a much larger reticule that turns from green to red when an enemy is targeted as opposed to a very narrow laser sight, a "quick knife" command is added that auto-targets the nearest enemy or object, and motion sensitive quick time event prompts are included as well as button presses. Visually the game is on par with the original GameCube version as opposed to the somewhat inferior graphics of the PlayStation 2 version, although in very few instances the inferior PS2 graphics are mistakenly retained such as herbs having lower detail models in some places. The Wii version also supports the Wii's Classic Controller, which reverts aiming and the laser sight back to the original format. The only other noticeable differences are that the game seems significantly easier, and that all of Leon's actions appear to move slightly faster.</summary>

      <review>which isn't really a bad thing but that influenced the newer games to being way too action-oriented\n \n some bosses are pretty boring and ashley is annoying at times but overall this is still a great game to playthrough</review>
      <review>definitely stood the test of time imo"</review>
      <review>'This version of the game makes it hard to go back to the other versions of RE4. The Wii Edition improves on the aiming by ten folds. Turning an already amazing game to perfection.'</review>

      <review>play this one. It is the best motion controlled shooter out there."</review>
      <review>"Not much I can say that hasn't been said before</review>
      <review>but yeah its pretty clear why this is considered one of the greats in gaming. Very rough in some areas and felt very funny going through this on a wii (haven't touched one in 4-ish years)</review>
      <review>but after a while it just felt right.\n \n I will note that despite the typical stuff that's brought up as being the 'worst' parts of this game- (like Ashley or the constant quick-time events) I never had much of an issue with these. Instead my least favorite segments are never brought up- like I've never heard anyone talk about this U3 fight.\n \n Bosses can be hit or miss</review>
      <review>but nothing feels quite as good as mowing down hordes with the shotgun or riding on the back of a bulldozer firing an smg. I'll have to sit on it before I consider it a favorite but its certainly up there. It's just hard to hate this kinda game."</review>

      <review>spyro</review>

      <review>which is honestly really cool in the same way getting an unknown thing in smash is. You get to learn a lil bit more about sonys various IPs that you might not have otherwise known</review>
      <review>I guess. Gameplaywise though this is definitely not smash brothers. You can only score points and defeat players by using super moves which makes most of the actual fighting kinda feel like irrelevant filler...? The game also lacks the special level of polish and attention to detail that nintendo puts in smash as well</review>
      <review>which just makes the overall experience underwhelming. However</review>
      <review>I'd still say this is worth at least a curious play</review>
      <review>since especially with modern sony being the party poopers that hate fun with the playstations legacy of IPs</review>
      <review>we ain't seeing most of the first-party characters in this game ever comin back. It's kinda like nintendo land in like getting that last little table scrap of content for neglected IPs that I enjoy. I'm glad this game came out when it did because if they did this concept again now it'd have the most uninspired roster known to man</review>

    <summary>The player takes the role of a namable Hero. The Hero's name has an effect on his statistical growth over the course of the game. Battles are fought in a turn-based format and experience points and gold are awarded after every battle, allowing the Hero to level-up in ability and allows them to buy better weapons, armor, and items. Progression consists of traveling over an overworld map and through dungeons, fighting monsters encountered via random battles along the journey.</summary>

You just work toward the next best items and explore all the dungeons for better stuff and then kill the guy! It’s so satisfying fighting monsters that you had trouble with a few levels ago and decimating them with the strength and weapon you grinded for.\n \n chef’s kiss\n \n mwah!'</review>

      <review>and you don't have to set your team as you can use whatever you would like. Assuming you grind them up</review>
      <review>hehe. That's really cool! Also the exploring. Oh man - I can't say much about it</review>
      <review>it just feels good. I hate it normally</review>

    <summary>Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir is an enhanced HD remake of Odin Sphere game for PlayStation 2. Many various adjustments and changes were made in gameplay, considering comments from people who played the original game. While this is enhanced version of the original and it's trying to stay true to it, there are new gameplay and story elements presented in this release, some of which include new boss fights, new attack moves, new background music, and new map area to explore. While the initial idea of the developers was to make just n HD remastered release, it ended up being more of a re-created game version. As such, the game offers both classic mode as well as refined mode with all new elements and new gameplay.</summary>

      <review>fun combat (especially as Velvet and Mercedes). I own and played the original ages back but never finished it."</review>
      <review>"don't ever fucking do a game with the same structure ever again vanillaware."</review>
      <review>"It's pretty great</review>
      <review>beautiful 2D art and a charming Norse mythology inspired story. Gameplay feels nice and smooth</review>
      <review>I enjoyed playing as every character more or less. Pretty good story with a well developed world."</review>
      <review>'Man</review>
      <review>they really make lovely looking games. I wish more games such vibrant and different art styles. It also felt great to play.'</review>
      <review>"I have complicated feelings on this one. Of course</review>
      <review>the presentation is fantastic. I think I am a bit spoiled having played 13 Sentinels first</review>
      <review>though. The faces are barely animated at all in this one</review>
      <review>and while I think it works for characters like Odin</review>
      <review>it does not do any favors for characters like Mercedes and Oswald. It makes everything they say feel a bit sarcastic (though this is not a jab at the english VA</review>
      <review>I liked it quite a bit). Far and away my biggest problem with this game is the structure. Each “book” has you playing as a different character</review>
      <review>who all play pretty different</review>
      <review>though being me I gravitated towards the nigh-uncontrollable flippy-dippy melee fighters. But with these characters</review>
      <review>you are going through the same 8ish areas</review>
      <review>fighting the same 30ish enemies</review>
      <review>ending with one of the same 10ish bosses in each level</review>
      <review>and it gets old really fast. I understand these assets probably cost a ton to produce and reusing them is resourceful</review>
      <review>but it is so much padding. It negatively impacts the story too. It's a great</review>
      <review>simple concept: viewing the lives of the children of these classic fantasy archetypes</review>
      <review>with the conclusion that they are pretty much all horrible parents. However</review>
      <review>it feels forced to go in certain directions just so I can fight the damn blue worm dragon for like the 5th book in a row. Not all of it is bad</review>
      <review>I love seeing little details in one book heavily expanded and explained in another book (like seeing why Pooka ran the food store in book 1 explained in book 2). However</review>
      <review>while it would require pretty extensive rewrites</review>
      <review>I would’ve preferred a 10-15 hour game reusing less gameplay elements rather than a 35 hour journey that feels pretty tiring by the middle of book 3. I wish I could’ve liked it more</review>
      <review>but it feels very forced into a structure that doesn’t benefit it."]</review>

    <summary>Bulletstorm brings new furor to first-person shooter action thanks to its signature 'kill with skill' gameplay. The game tells the story of a futuristic confederation protected by an elite band of mercenaries: Dead Echo. When Dead Echo members Grayson Hunt and Ishi Sato learn they've been working for the wrong side, they're betrayed by their commander and exiled to the far reaches of the galaxy. In Bulletstorm, Grayson and Ishi find themselves surrounded by hordes of mutants and flesh eating gangs in an abandoned paradise. They have two objectives: get off the planet alive, and exact revenge on the man who sent them there. Players step into the role of Grayson Hunt complete with an arsenal of over-the-top combat moves and outrageously large guns. Bulletstorm's array of distinct 'skillshots' produces unprecedented levels of frantic gameplay and yell-inducing satisfaction. The skillshot system rewards players for inciting mayhem in the most creative way possible. The more insane the skillshot, the more points players collects to upgrade their character and unlock weapons, which then allows them to execute even more creative moves and exaggerated skillshots.</summary>

      <review>'Jogo é um shooter diferente deixando a mecanica dele bem divertida com design de armas muito legais sinto que faltou um pouco de capricho no enredo e no carisma dos personagens mas é um bom jogo de qualquer forma'</review>
      <review>'Pretty mid overall but I remember it more than other shooters released at the time.'</review>
      <review>'pretty fun'</review>
      <review>'Not the game which you will count ever as your favotite</review>
      <review>but memorable enough modern consol-ish FPS title. While being not a "classic" shooter</review>
      <review>or</review>
      <review>for example</review>
      <review>Serious Sam clone</review>
      <review>like Painkiller</review>
      <review>it still speedy and action driven.\n \n The game also have pretty visuals for UE3 engine. If you love visual style and apperance of Starcraft 2</review>
      <review>this game is right in the same valley.\n \n Narrative is not deep or too serious</review>
      <review>characters are comical</review>
      <review>but I would\'ve not described it as "random". It just don\'t go deep into universe</review>
      <review>giving lots of stuff to your imagination. But what there is there. While being full of dity jokes</review>
      <review>I not find it cringe or offensive</review>
      <review>unlike some other titles.\n \n My only complains would be about only 3 weapon slots (4th one for heavier stuff would\'ve been a nice addition)</review>
      <review>sometimes repeative enemies</review>
      <review>maybe too much limits on character movement. However</review>
      <review>game defenetly has its moments. In general</review>

      <review>['The weakest animal crossing game but that’s because it was too similar to wild world and the town gimmick was more annoying than it was novel.'</review>
      <review>'your first ever animal crossing game really does hit different\n \n really good vibes and timeless soundtrack! !!'</review>
      <review>'The best Animal Crossing game in my opinion. Super simple with lots of reasons to revisit your town time and time again.'</review>
      <review>'not sure why i didnt log this earlier. played this a lot on release</review>
      <review>enjoyed it for what it was but obviously does not stack up to WW or its successors.'</review>
      <review>'Animal Crossing City folk took Wild World and improved what was good about it and made it better!'</review>
      <review>"it's animal crossing</review>
      <review>the staple mechanics'll never be bad so i cannot rate it any less</review>
      <review>but the soundtrack is strangely the thing that kept throwing me off because it's the same as wild world's (with different instruments). this is a really subjective point</review>
      <review>but it's strange</review>
      <review>even with more updated instrumentation the very composition of wild world's soundtracks make me expect something a little smaller/minimal than a (comparatively) high framerate console edition (and the original compositions suit it really well!)</review>
      <review>but i'll put this down to association from years of playing wild world really lol. do also agree with the grass mechanics that the ground itself doesn't look as lovely</review>
      <review>haven't played enough to determine if this really is the point where the dialogue went downhill but i've got my suspicions (!). not to mention how difficult i find adjusting to the wii compared to a standard controller for this specific kind of game</review>
      <review>but again it's a subjective one. boy</review>
      <review>this is a whole lot of complaining for an animal crossing game- well other than the grass the graphics are fantastically charming as always and fit right into the cosy visuals of the game for me</review>
      <review>especially indoors</review>
      <review>as always each object feels lovingly rendered - plus this game began pro patterns! definitely worth visiting on a tour of the older games especially for charm</review>
      <review>but I'm not sure how well it'll age as an example of the series in terms of exemplifying its gameplay decades down the line."]</review>

    <summary>Sonic 3D Blast is a 1996 platform video game developed by Traveller's Tales and Sonic Team, and published by Sega for the Genesis, Saturn, and Windows. Part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the game abandons previous Sonic games' side-scrolling style in favor of isometric gameplay, making use of some pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites. The game features creatures known as Flickies, which first appeared in the 1984 arcade game Flicky. Controlling only Sonic himself, the player's goal is to collect Flickies and carry them to safety, periodically sparring with the series antagonist Dr. Robotnik, who is imprisoning them within robots.</summary>

      <review>but I personally really enjoy this game. Probably because I grew up playing it</review>
      <review>yeah</review>
      <review>and the fact that worlds were now interactable in an isometric 3D plane helped me grow a taste for exploring worlds and appreciating environment designs in video games which is neat. But I can see if you are looking for a more traditional sonic experience why it could be disappointing. I think that the game has some really interesting level themes like the gene gadget and rusty ruin zones</review>
      <review>as well as more traditional grass/ice/lava levels. The OST is also absolutely fantastic. The original programmer of the game</review>
      <review>Jon Burton</review>
      <review>made his own romhack enhancing the control and adding new features such as super sonic and a map screen which is super cool</review>

      <review>"If you like the old N64 Mario Party formula</review>
      <review>then this is the last game to follow that</review>
      <review>really. This game is basically an N64 Mario Party game but on the Gamecube</review>
      <review>so that is honestly pretty cool. While this game upgrades a lot of things from 3</review>
      <review>they added a new game mechanic with the mega/mini mushroom system that drastically changes board design and what items to use</review>
      <review>so I'd day its slightly worse than 3 at worst</review>
      <review>and on par with 3 at best. The battle boards from 3 are also completely gone</review>
      <review>seems like that stuff was a one-off thing. Anyways</review>
      <review>it's Mario Party. If you think that the newer Mario Party games have too many gimmicks and only own a GameCube for some reason</review>

    <summary>Mario Party 3 is the third and final Mario Party title for the Nintendo 64. A total of eight characters are available to choose from: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, and newcomers Waluigi and Princess Daisy. Mario Party 3 features duel maps, in which two players try to lower each other's stamina to zero using non-playable characters such as Chain Chomps. It is the first Mario Party game to feature Luigi's main voice and also it is last Mario game where Princess Daisy appears in a yellow and white dress, and with long hair, as well as the last Mario game (until New Super Mario Bros. Wii) in which Yoshi's "record-scratching" voice is used. It is also the first Mario Party game to have multiple save slots.</summary>

      <review>'WALUIGI IS HERE BAABYYYYYYYYYYY'</review>
      <review>"Definitely the Mario Party on N64 with the most content. Includes a story mode for those lonely players out there. As a multiplayer experience</review>
      <review>its mario party. It basically does what you expect. Really whether or not you should blast this or 2 just comes down to preference</review>
      <review>since 2 is just 1 but with less hand pain</review>
      <review>and this has entirely different minigames than 2 does. As a single player experience</review>
      <review>it is kinda repetitive as well as the fact that winning mario party games is largely RNG based</review>
      <review>so sometimes the AI will just curbstomp you without you being able to do much about it. There are also unique duel maps that have an interesting different game mode attatched to them where you have partners fight each other and what not. All in all</review>
      <review>its mario party. This is also the only N64 mario party to have waluigi and daisy</review>
      <review>so fans of those characters should pick this over 2. Also this game has most of the actual mario voices instead of the weird voices that were in the first 2 games as well</review>
      <review>so it's definitely a different vibe. Probably the strongest in the classic trilogy."</review>

      <review>['Pretty good game. I like the force powers and levels aren’t that bad. The graphics are decent too. However</review>
      <review>the story feels disconnected and it isn’t as explored as the movie</review>

It sports a skeleton of a middle of the road narrative so really there is no reason to bother with it unless you’re interested in what “the first immersive sim” is like but even then those aspects are clumsy and unrefined.'</review>

    <summary>Ristar is a platform game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis in 1995. A Sega Game Gear game, of the same name and genre, Ristar, was also released, which shared similar themes while possessing different level design and gameplay mechanics. The game stars an anthropomorphic cartoon star who uses his hands and long, stretchable arms to both move and combat enemies. Reception for the game has been generally positive, but the game's initial release was overshadowed due to the imminent ending of the Genesis's lifecycle and the succession of the Sega Saturn and other fifth generation video game consoles. While never receiving any sequels, Sega has re-released the game a number of times digitally and on Sega-themed compilations, and has occasionally given Ristar himself cameos in other Sega properties.</summary>

      <review>["Complete playthrough on hard difficulty</review>
      <review>including all bonus stages completed. While I wouldn't say that I\n \n loved\n \n\n Ristar\n \n</review>
      <review>it's undeniably impressive in a number of ways. A lesser-known 2D mascot platformer</review>
      <review>it has some quite unusual mechanics</review>
      <review>with the protagonist</review>
      <review>an anthropomorphised star</review>
      <review>using his extensible arms to help with navigating stages and basic combat through a grab move. Bright</review>
      <review>vibrantly-coloured graphics across a range of creatively-designed environments are consistently attractive</review>
      <review>and the levels themselves are each quite expansive in both dimensions. Sadly</review>
      <review>some frustrations in controls hold the game back from true greatness</review>
      <review>particularly so in the later stages and bosses - but at least with the benefits of emulation</review>
      <review>those can be someone alleviated."</review>
      <review>"Ristar is a crown jewel of the Genesis collection. Vibrant art</review>
      <review>cohesive level themes</review>
      <review>creative bosses</review>
      <review>a bopping soundtrack</review>
      <review>and great applications of a grapple make this game sing. Level themes are mostly traditional</review>
      <review>but all are suited to Ristar's moves and pace. Shifts in momentum make more sense than in most platformers and even swimming and ice levels are fun rather than frustrating. It's overly demanding of reflexes</review>
      <review>especially in the late game</review>
      <review>but that's just a spot of tarnish."</review>
      <review>'If this came out today by an indie studio</review>
      <review>it would have been praised for its creativity. In 1995</review>
      <review>it\'s likely that Ristar was ignored as "just another mascot platformer" - a damn shame</review>
      <review>as this the definition of a "hidden gem".'</review>
      <review>'A slightly more methodical but solid platformer from the tailend of the mega drive. It suffers from some bonkers random difficulty spikes across but the level design is creative.'</review>
      <review>'I\'ve heard several ways to pronounce the name of this game over the years. Personally</review>
      <review>I\'ve always said "rye-star</review>
      <review>" though "ree-star" also makes sense as both pronunciations refer to the fact that Ristar is a star. If you say "wrister" because he "grabs things with this\n \n wrists\n \n (?????)" then you\'re demonic. Identify yourselves in the comments and submit yourself to Gamer Reeducation (me yelling at you.)'</review>
      <review>'I love this game. I wish I had something more meaningful to say but god I love this game. I love all killer no filler genesis platformers that pack so much into such a lovely little package of 6 stages. I love these jewel oranges and purples. I love water levels with the courtesy to let you move faster. I love building up as much speed as possible while pole swinging and then pinballing myself across the stage without a care in the world.

Homer, who punches and kicks; Marge, who swings her vacuum cleaner; Bart, who wields his skateboard; and Lisa, who uses a jump rope as a whip. Other weapons such as hammers and bowling balls are also available to use. The game's levels are Downtown Springfield, Krustyland, Springfield Discount Cemetery, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Gorge, Dreamland, the Channel 6 studio, and the Power Plant. Each level ends with a boss whose speed and strength will increase after taking a certain amount of damage. Between levels, the player can compete against the other characters in two mini-games to be first to complete a task (inflating a balloon and waking up their character).</summary>

    <summary>Rock Band 2 is the sequel to the 2007 musical simulation game Rock Band and offers similar gameplay. Directly competing with Guitar Hero: World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set. The new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.</summary>

      <review>"This game is pretty much rock band 1 but with a few tweaks and an entirely fresh setlist. I'd say the quality of the setlist is about the same between the first and second games</review>
      <review>but this one luckily doesn't have any green grass and high tides so that gives this games setlist the slight edge. A lot of songs are in guitar hero world tour so don't play those two games back to back like I did otherwise you will get sick and tired of a few songs. The biggest improvement this game has over the first one is you can do the campaign as a single-player experience as well as customize each individual band member and even make a band logo which is neat. Other than that though</review>
      <review>Rock Band do be Rock Band. Me and my brother teamed up to relay through the endless setlist on expert to get both the bladder of steel achievement and the platinum artist trophy on the same go</review>
      <review>so that's something I'll always remember."</review>

      <review>and boosting now doesn't even take your energy unless you're flying. The older games are much more strategic in what you needed to use and how to do it</review>
      <review>this one is very straightforward instead. This does lead to balance that is clearly towards light ACs</review>
      <review>no matter what I did I could never make a quad AC work as well as my simple super lightweight AC</review>
      <review>specially since heavy weapons</review>
      <review>such as the back cannon</review>
      <review>have very heavy recoil that stops you on your tracks</review>
      <review>and not moving 24/7 like it's fucking Doom Eternal is an objectively bad strategy. There's also a lot less parts than the previous installments</review>
      <review>for example there's only around 6 heavy back weapons</review>
      <review>2 quad legs and 2 tank threads. Nonetheless</review>
      <review>I can excuse some of these changes as the game is very different from previous installments like I mentioned. Even the plot is different</review>
      <review>having less of a feel towards being a simple mercenary and more of being a heroic soldier.\n \n Overall</review>
      <review>it is an interesting take on the series</review>
      <review>and I do wonder what will For Answer be like."</review>
      <review>'Armored Core 4 is a very interesting title. Starting with this iteration the franchise took a radical departure from the slower more methodical gameplay of the previous entries in favor of a much faster pace and more streamlined mechanics. In some instances it works incredibly well and in others it feels like a case of one step forward two steps back.'</review>
      <review>"Give me your White Glint</review>
      <review>bitch.\n \n You're not using it anymore."</review>
      <review>'"Let\'s confirm the mission."'</review>
      <review>"Armored Core 4 is a radical departure from the previous games in both the way the game is played and presented especially with Miyazaki on his debut as the director. While customization isn't as deep as before</review>
      <review>missions are short and the environments feel like a step behind</review>
      <review>the moment-to-moment gameplay is really fun and felt like a step in the right direction as the series moved to a new generation. The satisfaction of completing a level is also complemented to the story</review>
      <review>more notably the player mercenary/operator relationship developing as you finish each mission. The story was also nice and had some signs of greatness</review>
      <review>but I feel like it could have elevated to something better if not for a few missteps. The soundtrack bangs as expected from an AC game. Definitely recommend this one and it also runs well on an emulator."</review>
      <review>'too short</review>
      <review>too easy</review>

My parents had a friend bring the Saturn version over once during a really bad storm. I remember seeing the arcades as well. I wound up renting it for Super Nintendo and had a blast. I mostly loved the much darker and more mature tone the series took. MKII felt more cartoony and stylish while MK3 felt like it pushed the first game's realism even further."</review>

    <summary>In the game, each player controls one of the two Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob. The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games. The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated. Enemies turn "angry" — becoming pink-colored and moving faster — if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however, this is a rare occurrence). After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player's life is lost. Contact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) results in death.</summary>

    <summary>Shantae embarks on her first full HD adventure! After three highly successful outings with Shantae, Shantae: Risky's Revenge, and Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, Shantae and her friends finally get a full HD console-based sequel! Boasting vivid, detailed high-definition graphics that retain the 2D hand-drawn sprites the series is known for, this newest entry in the Shantae series almost looks like a playable TV show! Presented as a stage-based 2.5D platformer with heavy exploration elements, Shantae uses her trademark Hair-Whip Attack to dispatch enemies, then takes advantage of her Belly Dance Magic to transform into 8 different forms that each have their own unique abilities and move sets. As new forms are mastered, old stages can be re-explored to unearth new items and secrets, ensuring there's plenty of content on offer for novices and platforming gurus alike. Topple the villainous Baron behind each criminal caper afflicting Sequin Land, and prepare for the ultimate showdown against Shantae's arch-nemesis: that bodacious buccaneer, Risky Boots!</summary>

      <review>["Unlike the last game</review>
      <review>this one removes the more explict metroidvania approach for a more linear stage based structure</review>
      <review>but at the same time the main story still requires you to backtrack to these stages for items to progress</review>
      <review>and going back to the older stages just isn't that fun. The bosses are hit and miss</review>
      <review>with more leaning on the miss side. The actual level design is good however</review>
      <review>and carries the game."</review>
      <review>'It has A LOT going for it. The soundtrack is S tier</review>
      <review>the design is S tier</review>
      <review>the level design I think is S tier</review>
      <review>but compared to the previous game</review>
      <review>the actual gameplay is a little slower and thus not as enjoyable. Luckily people are telling me the gameplay in the next entry is perfection.'</review>
      <review>"For the first time in the series</review>
      <review>levels have become very straight forward</review>
      <review>the Metroidvania aspect is kinda gone here</review>
      <review>but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. Half-Genie Hero gave Shantae a whole new artstyle</review>
      <review>DLCs</review>
      <review>a fanart gallery and more! It's definitely very charming and colorful</review>
      <review>nice game!"</review>
      <review>"It's pretty alright! Shantae goes back to her roots</review>
      <review>and honestly it really does feel that way.\n \n First off</review>
      <review>I REALLY like this game's art style. Whenever I imagine what Shantae\n \n is\n \n</review>
      <review>this is always how I imagine it.\n \n The story is pretty bland. Unfortunate to see after Pirate Curse and even Risky's Revenge. Those stories weren't AMAZING or anything</review>
      <review>but they at least had something that made it memorable to me. The only thing I could think of while playing this game when thinking about the story was thinking about how it feels like a Saturday morning cartoon. It feels very cartoony and cheesy</review>
      <review>it's not really a BAD thing</review>
      <review>I just didn't really expect it.\n \n Gameplay is pretty alright. It's your normal Shantae gameplay but I didn't expect how many dances there would be. I only needed a few more dances and I would've gotten 100%.\n \n The music is good</review>
      <review>though not as good as Pirate's Curse. I didn't expect a lyrical song though! That was a fun surprise.\n \n Overall</review>
      <review>It felt like Shantae back to basics. It's alright</review>
      <review>but not as good as the previous game. Oh wait</review>
      <review>theres also DLC! Pirate Queen's Quest is mid</review>
      <review>and Friends to the End sucks."</review>
      <review>'Giga Mermaid gets 5 stars tho'</review>
      <review>'This game looks great and plays hella snappy.']</review>
